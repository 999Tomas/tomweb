            <p class="scroll-object">
                In today's digital age, social media platforms have become an integral part of our lives, not only for personal use, but also for professional purposes. Among the many platforms available, I chose Instagram and LinkedIn as my primary channels for showcasing my work and connecting with potential employers.
                <br>
                <br>
                Instagram, a social media behemoth with over a billion monthly active users, has emerged as a formidable platform for showcasing one's artistic prowess. Its visually captivating interface serves as an ideal canvas for creatives, like myself, a 3D visualiser, to exhibit our work and connect with a vast audience. By leveraging the platform's emphasis on visual content, we can effectively convey our skills, artistic style, and boundless imagination to our followers. Through the strategic sharing of high-quality images and captivating videos, we engage our audience, inviting them to immerse themselves in our creative journey. This exposure not only broadens our reach, but also fosters new opportunities for collaboration and growth. Instagram's vibrant community provides a unique platform for creatives to connect, inspire, and collaborate, propelling us forward in our artistic endeavours.
                <br>
                <br>
                On the other hand, LinkedIn is another platform I chose to use for professional purposes. As the world's largest professional network, LinkedIn boasts over 740 million users worldwide, making it an essential tool for job seekers, freelancers, and business professionals. The platform's primary focus is on connecting individuals with potential employers, clients, and collaborators, making it an ideal place to showcase one's skills, experience, and accomplishments.

            <h5>1.1 Account Inspiration: A Journey to Curate the Perfect Instagram Aesthetic</h5>
            <p>
                Before embarking on the journey of creating content for social platforms, I delved into research on Instagram accounts that inspire me. I wasn't sure what template to use for my Instagram, what colours I wanted my board to present to my visitors, or how to make it visually appealing. However, I knew that I wanted a minimalistic board. Thus, I decided to compile a list of my favourite accounts to serve as inspiration.
                <br>
                <br>
                After thorough research, I found that the black and white style of creation, coupled with a blue template, resonated with my vision for the Instagram account. The combination of these colours and the minimalistic approach to design created a harmonious and visually pleasing aesthetic that I believe would captivate my audience.
                <br>
                <br>
                Here are some accounts that inspired me:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alan_schaller/" target="_blank">@alan_schaller</a>
                        (Figure 1.1.1) - This account is a true embodiment of minimalism, featuring clean, simple, and elegant designs. The monochromatic colour scheme and the use of negative space make the content stand out, and I found myself drawn to the simplicity and sophistication of their posts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/todays_blue_collection/" target="_blank">@todays_blue_collection</a> (Figure 1.1.2) - This account features a beautiful blend of blue hues, showcasing the versatility and beauty of this colour. The account's use of blue in various shades and tones inspired me to incorporate blue into my own Instagram aesthetic, as it complements the black and white style and adds a touch of colour without overwhelming the minimalistic design.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/abu888/" target="_blank">@abu888</a> (Figure 1.1.3) - As the name suggests, this account is dedicated to showcasing stunning black and white photography. The account's curation of high-quality images inspired me to explore the use of contrast and texture in my own content, as well as the power of black and white to evoke emotion and create a timeless feel.

            <h5>1.2 Target Audience</h5>
            <p class="scroll-object">
                Embarking on a social media campaign project requires the strategic development of a platform that effectively engages a target audience. This is a crucial step in ensuring the success of any social media campaign, as it allows you to tailor your content and messaging to the specific interests and preferences of your intended audience.
                <br>
                <br>
                To begin with, it's crucial to identify the demographic we want to engage with. In my case, I decided to focus on older professionals, as I believe my content, which revolves around 3D visualisation of buildings, environments, cities, interior, and product design, would resonate well with this audience. This decision was based on my understanding of the interests and preferences of this demographic, as well as the potential for growth and engagement within this niche.
                <br>
                <br>
                I started by researching the interests and preferences of my target audience. This involved analysing the content they engage with, the influencers they follow, and the hashtags they use. By understanding their behaviour, I could tailor my content to better align with their interests and preferences. For example, I discovered that older professionals are more likely to engage with informative, educational, and visually appealing content. As a result, I focused on creating high-quality visuals and providing detailed explanations of my 3D visualisation process.
                <br>
                Once I had identified my target audience and the most effective social media platforms, I began to develop a content strategy that would help me engage with my followers and build a strong online presence.

            <h5>1.3 Strategies</h5>
            <p>
                I devised strategies for two platforms: Instagram and LinkedIn.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h6>INSTAGRAM</h6>
            <p>
                On Instagram, I sought to showcase my personal journey and ignite inspiration in others by sharing my passion for design, specifically exterior and interior visuals. As I had limited followers initially, I set a target of reaching 200 by the campaign's end. To achieve this, I curated a series of posts that highlighted my projects and experiences, demonstrating the growth and evolution of my work. I also engaged with followers through comments and direct messages, fostering a sense of community.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h6>LINKEDIN</h6>
            <p>
                On LinkedIn, my strategy was to establish a professional presence, while leveraging the platform's focus on business and employment. I shared the same content as on Instagram, but with a more in-depth perspective on my work, challenges, learnings, and accomplishments.  By actively engaging on both platforms, I aimed to generate interest in my work, build a loyal following, and ultimately achieve my campaign goals.

                <br>
                <br>
                Figure 1.4.2 showcases the visual elements I intend to use. My initial plan was to publish ten posts, each strategically designed to engage my audience.
                <br>
                <br>
                1.4.3 figure illustrates the process of creating a final post. On the left, a black and white visual represents the final post, while the right side showcases all the original renders used to create it. This visual breakdown highlights the journey from initial concepts to a polished, minimalist presentation
                <br>
                <br>
                Figure 1.4.4 represents my first venture beyond interior visualisations, driven by a desire to showcase my abilities in a broader context and expand my portfolio.
                <br>
                Inspired by the intriguing architectural design of my close relatives' new house project, I embarked on a transformative journey to visualise its unique design, using their CAD plans as a starting point.
                <br>
                Despite lacking a structured approach or preliminary sketches, I relied on reference images and dove into the creation process, driven by enthusiasm and thirst for knowledge.
                <br>
                While my inexperience is evident in some design choices, this project represents a significant step in my growth as a 3D artist, showcasing my early explorations and the boundless potential I saw in this new creative avenue.
                <br>
                <br>
                Figure 1.4.5 shows a series of images depicting the current state of the house, accompanied by corresponding floor plan and section screenshots.
                <br>
                While this project was primarily undertaken for personal learning and portfolio enhancement, the project owners did not specifically request exterior visuals. Nevertheless, they found value in some of my ideas regarding the plant area.
                <br>
                I included these images to demonstrate my early skills as a beginner and to showcase my ability to read and interpret plans, as the proportions and scale appear consistent.
                <br>
                However, I made a significant error in my visuals: the family dog room lacks a window, which is crucial for any living space (figure 1.4.4). I attribute this oversight to a lack of communication and elevation plans.
                <br>
                <br>
                Figure 1.4.6 showcases a monorail project rendered in Blender, a software I was eager to master. This project was my playground for exploring monorail modelling and animation. To create a realistic environment, I built a city complete with water views, buildings, street lamps, roads, walking and cycling paths, and other urban assets.
                <br>
                This project allowed me to overcome many obstacles, like perfecting the look of my monorail's windows and doors after subdivision. Through this process, I gained a much deeper understanding and comfort level with Blender.
                <br>
                <br>
                Figure 1.4.7 showcases the original render and post version.
                <br>
                Last summer, I had the opportunity to work with the client project.
                <br>
                This is a new build of a 91 sqm one-story house. The main goal for this project was to use the 3D software and provide my clients with a realistic visualisation of their future space.
                <br>
                <br>
                Figure 1.4.8 showcases the progress of my clients' projects, with recent images capturing the transformation taking place. On the right hand side, design elements incorporated into the project, reflecting my clients' unique requests.
                <br>
                The design brief called for an open-plan living space with a dominant colour scheme of grey shades. Emerald green was to be used as an accent colour for the soft furnishings. In the kitchen, a floor-to-ceiling glass cabinet was desired, while the hallway featured a gallery wall of family photographs. These were the primary requirements outlined by the clients.
                <br>
                These details demonstrate my commitment to understanding and fulfilling their visions, transforming their dreams into tangible realities.
                <br>
                <br>
                Figure 1.4.9 charts the evolution of my RSA project, 'Container Home,' from initial inspiration to finalised design.
                <br>
                It contrasts an initial Instagram post with a systematic development process, starting with inspiring images and sketches. These were then transformed into a 3D clay render, culminating in a final render.<br>
                However, the project wasn't static. A detailed questionnaire with my target audience (older individuals seeking comfortable and practical living spaces) revealed the initial design was too small. This critical feedback led to a significant redesign, ensuring the 'Container Home' evolved into a truly functional and desirable dwelling for its intended occupants.

            <h5>1.5 Posting (Start): A Journey into Instagram</h5>
            <p class="scroll-object">
                My first three Instagram posts were a significant milestone in my journey as a digital artist. They marked the beginning of my public presence, where I shared my work and creative process with the world. The first post was on the 4th of March, followed by the second on the 11th, and the third on the 13th of the same month.
                <br>
                <br>
                (Figure 1.5.1) - The first post was a brief introduction about myself and the projects I planned to share in the coming days. I wanted to give my followers a glimpse into my creative process and the ideas that inspired me. This post served as a foundation for my future posts, setting the tone for the type of content I would share on my Instagram page.
                <br>
                <br>
                (Figure 1.5.2) - The second post was an interior visualisation project that I had worked on using 3ds Max software. This was my first attempt to create professional-looking visualisations. I was eager to showcase my skills and the progress I had made in learning the software. 
                <br>
                <br> 
                (Figure 1.5.3) - My third post was a personal challenge I had set for myself. I wanted to learn the Blender software, which I had been introduced to during my first year of university. To test my skills, I decided to create a monorail model and visualise it in a city view. Additionally, I aimed to learn how to animate the monorail model, further expanding my skills.
                <br>
                <br>
                These posts received limited engagement.
                <br>
                Despite the limited engagement on these initial posts, I was determined to learn from my experiences and improve my content. I began researching ways to make my posts more engaging and visually appealing, as well as exploring different strategies to connect with my audience.

            <p>
                To enhance audience engagement on Instagram and foster audience growth, I embarked on a comprehensive research endeavour. My findings revealed the efficacy of Reels as a powerful tool for captivating audiences with my 3D creations. Consequently, I pivoted my content strategy, allocating significant time to crafting compelling Reels.
                <br>
                The process required meticulous preparation, consuming several weeks of my schedule.
                <br>
                Each reel meticulously showcases my 3D artistry, offering a captivating visual experience designed to engage viewers, inspire their imaginations, and foster a deeper connection with my brand. By embracing Reels as a cornerstone of my content strategy, I aim to captivate a broader audience, generate more meaningful interactions.

            <h6>Account Reached</h6>
            <p>
                During the project period, upon posting my creation on Instagram, I achieved 234 accounts, with a significant 68% of non-followers.
                <br> 
                This result reflects the potential for expanding my audience beyond my existing followers. However, I encountered a lower level of engagement, with only 42 accounts interacting with my content. Notably, 75% of these interactions came from followers. While I am pleased with the reach achieved, the low engagement rate indicates a need to enhance the quality and relevance of my content.
                <br> 
                By carefully analysing the performance of my previous posts, I aim to identify areas for improvement, such as optimising the use of relevant hashtags, crafting more engaging captions, and incorporating visually appealing elements.
                <br> 
                I am confident that by investing time and effort into refining my content, I can foster greater interaction and engagement with both followers and non-followers alike.

            <h6>Follower Growth</h6>
            <p>
                My Instagram insights indicate a 32.6% follower growth, resulting in 32 new followers. While this is a positive trend, it falls short of my goal of gaining 100 followers during the period. I attribute this shortfall to my lack of consistency in posting after my initial three posts.
                <br> 
                The first post performed well, but the subsequent two failed to generate engagement. This prompted me to reassess my posting strategy and shift my focus to creating reels.
                <br> 
                Crafting six reels, especially the monorail project, was a time-consuming process due to numerous errors that required rectification. Consequently, I resumed posting reels on April 13th.

                My primary objective was to leverage 3D software to provide my clients with a realistic visualisation of their future living space.
                <br> 
                I decided to showcase it in a reel for my university's 'Social Media Campaign' project.
                <br> 
                To my delight, the reel achieved success, reaching 125 people, with a significant 63.5% being non-followers (Figure 1.7.1). The reel garnered 212 plays, including 142 initial plays and 70 replays.<br> 
                This positive reception inspired me to create more reels of this nature, recognising their potential to effectively showcase my work and engage with a wider audience.

While my limited time has hindered my ability to fully engage on LinkedIn, I recognise its significance for both businesses and individuals. Therefore, I remain committed to investing time and effort into growing my presence on this platform, with the aim of maximising its potential to connect with a broader professional network and showcase my expertise.

            <p class="scroll-object">
                The social media project has been an incredibly enlightening and transformative experience for me. It has taught me valuable lessons that I will carry throughout my personal and professional life.
                <br>
                <br>
                Firstly, I have learned to overcome my shyness when it comes to sharing my interests and passions on social media platforms. By posting content that resonates with me, I have discovered that I can connect with like-minded individuals and foster a sense of community. This has not only boosted my confidence, but also allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of my audience's preferences and dislikes.
                <br>
                <br>
                Moreover, the project has taught me the importance of crafting posts in a proficient manner. By honing my writing skills and focusing on delivering valuable content, I have been able to engage my audience more effectively. This has not only increased my reach, but also helped me establish myself as a knowledgeable and reliable source of information in my niche.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another significant lesson I have learned is the art of creating reels. Initially, I struggled with the technical aspects of this format, but through consistent practice and experimentation, I have improved my skills significantly. I can now create reels more efficiently and with greater creativity, which has undoubtedly enhanced my social media presence.
                <br>
                <br>
                Furthermore, the project has encouraged me to be more vocal in expressing my opinions and sharing my thoughts on posts that I find interesting or inspiring. By engaging in meaningful conversations with others, I have not only expanded my network, but also gained valuable insights and perspectives from people with diverse backgrounds and experiences.
                <br>
                <br>
                In conclusion, the social media project has been an invaluable learning experience that has helped me grow both personally and professionally. By embracing the lessons I have learned, I am confident that I can continue to evolve and thrive in the ever-changing landscape of social media.
