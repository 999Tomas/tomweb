            <h5>1 Introduction to Project</h5>
            <p>The project is commissioned for a client Rob Blofield. Our client wants to bring his Tomebound game idea to life.<br>
                The Tomebound game is set in a magical world filled with ancient tomes, mysterious artefacts, and powerful spells waiting to be discovered. Players take on the role of brave adventurer who must navigate their way through treacherous dungeons and solve complex puzzles to uncover the secrets hidden within the tomes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As a team member, my main goal was to improve my skills in a specific area and contribute to the development of the game.<br>
                After careful consideration, I decided to take on the challenge of creating a Wizard character. This would not only allow me to hone my skills in sculpting, texture baking, painting, and rigging, but also to add a unique and captivating character to the game.<br>
                Our project manager created the base mesh for the lizard.<br>
                My responsibility was to create the costume for the lizard.<br>
                Here is my story development, from research to implementation.

            <h5>1.1 Brainstorming</h5>
         <p>I used AI- to generate the concept and ideas further. I added best results and annotated my thinking.<br>
        
             The simplicity of the design not only allows for easy animation, but also gives the character a practical and functional look.<br> 
        
             In collaboration with the concept art designer, we carefully crafted the wizard's costume.<br>
    
             The visual impact of the wizard's magic is enhanced by the wide bell sleeves and the layers on the shoulder and front of the cloak, adding dimension and detail without being too distracting.<br> 
    
             The addition of a side bag element with a belt buckle not only adds to the practicality of the design, but also gives the character a unique and functional touch.<br> 
        
         
             The hat with its cone shape, thick strip, and buckle detail is a distinguishing feature of the wizard, setting them apart from other characters.<br> 
             The choice of chunky boots without additional elements is a practical decision, as the player will not see them from a top view.<br> 
    
             The facial features of the wizard, including closed eyes, thick shaggy eyebrows, a proportional nose, and a bandholz waved beard, all contribute to the aesthetic and personality of the character.<br> 

             These AI-generated concept ideas have successfully captured the essence of a powerful and mystical wizard and will serve as a great foundation for creating a dynamic and captivating character in a game.

            <h5>1.2 Costume Blockout</h5>
            <p>1.2.1 After brainstorming ideas for a wizard costume, I created 3D block-outs.<br>
Using the details and concepts we discussed in our brainstorming session; I meticulously crafted each element of the costume in 3D form. 
When I displayed my 3D block-outs to my manager, he was pleased with the result.<br> 
His positive reaction made me feel confident in my work and motivated me to continue refining the costume.
</p>
<p>1.2.2 This solid mode with random colours allowed me to see clearer the layers of the costume. On this part of the mode, I created facial features.<br>
Here were a few of my mistakes. My moustache was only in x axis. The beard was not with sideburns. The sleeve layers were on a low level of subdivision. Also, I forgot to create chunky boots. Final feedback to improve thickness of belt model.<br>

I realised the importance of having a second pair of eyes to review my work and provide valuable insights.<br> 

It also taught me the importance of being open to feedback and constantly striving for improvement. 
</p>
<p>
    1.2.3 The last visual demonstrates how I took into account the suggestions of the art manager and made necessary changes to make the costume even better.

            <h5>1.3 A New Idea</h5>
              <p>Who knew that a simple typo could lead to such an unexpected and exciting turn of events?<br>

The world of gaming has always been a place of imagination and innovation, constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible.<br>

And in this world, character design plays a crucial role in bringing a game to life.<br>

That's where the art concept artist comes in, by creating an AI concept, and via typo, searched for "wizard lizards" by mistake.
</p>
<p>
    It created the incredible wizard lizard concept ideas, a character that combines elements of magical powers of a wizard and the agility and cunning of a lizard. Thus, resulting in a truly unique and fascinating creature.
</p>
<p>
    We both as team members with the wizard character responsibilities artist agreed on this idea.<br>

The idea of a wizard lizard as a brand identity seemed so much more playful and approachable, while still maintaining a sense of intelligence and power.<br>

The concept of wizard lizards will also be developed further, making them more relatable to a wider audience. 
</p>
<p>
    However, as the artist, I couldn't help but worry about the time constraints we were under. Creating a detailed and visually appealing character design takes a lot of time and effort.<br>
    But our tutor reassured me and assured us that we had enough time to complete the project. His words of encouragement and confidence in our ability gave me the reassurance I needed to fully commit to the project and put my best effort into it.

            <h5>1.4 Concept Improvement</h5>

<p> Here I am show casing my Viewport renders. It is my final costume design with our new character Wizard Lizard base mesh.<br> 
    Our art manager created the fundamental mesh of character.<br>
    I used all block-outs created for the previous virgin character, except the chunky boots and facial features. Block-outs were out of place, it didn't fit with the overall of our new idea for the character.<br> 

    We also, ultimately decided that removing the hat would greatly improve the player's ability to identify the character. This also added a level of personalisation and emotional connection to the character. 
</p>
<p>
    The wizard lizard model proportions were smaller than the previous wizard mesh. This resulted in the costume being resized to fit on base mesh.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, I created an ancient, stylised footwear. In general, our wizard lizard now has a more whimsical and magical appearance. 
</p>

<p>
    The final result is a stunning and unique costume that truly makes our Wizard Lizard stand out from other game characters.

    <div class="item item-sculpting-text">
          <h5>1.5 Sculpting</h5>
          <p>The next is sculpting. This is a crucial stage, as it allows more intricate details to be added to the design, resulting in a more stylised and visually appealing character. 
          </p>
          <p>
              However, this stage was time-consuming, as I only used it once in my previous 'Dr Pepi' project last year.<br>
              Before beginning the sculpting process, I added a multi-resolution modifier to my mesh. This allowed me to subdivide the mesh into multiple levels, giving me the ability to sculpt fine details in high resolution. I then used various brushes to create wrinkle details on the model of my character's cloak and hood, making it appear more realistic and natural. I also focused on smoothing out any rough edges, giving it a more natural and draped look over the body. This stage involved a lot of experimentation and trial and error, as I had to constantly go back and forth between different levels of subdivision to ensure that the details were realistic and not too exaggerated. 
          </p>
          <p>
              Although it was a tedious process, seeing my character come to life with each added detail was incredibly satisfying.<br>
              Overall, sculpting was a crucial step in bringing my costume design to life and elevating it from a flat to a three-dimensional work of art. It added depth, texture, and personality to my character, making it more realistic and engaging for the audience.

            <h5>1.6 Clay & Topology Renders</h5>
            <p> The clean and simple look of the clay render view makes it easier to spot any errors or missing details, allowing for a more precise and accurate final product.<br> 
            In this situation, the clay render on left hand side, it is clear that I identified the imperfection between my hood mesh edge layer, which had a big gap. It was not touching the hood model. Thus, after that I fixed it.<br>
            It is also a great way to showcase the intricate details and hard work put into the model, as it highlights every curve and edge. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In the world of 3D modelling and animation, topology is a key aspect. It is a crucial factor in creating quality and realistic animations. This is why I always pay close attention to my topology when creating 3D models.<br>

            On the right-hand side is an example of my good topology by rendering a Viewport image<br>

            My past error experience has taught me valuable lessons about the significance of actively managing and monitoring the mesh topology. It is vital to never become complacent and assume everything is functioning correctly. Regular checks and proactive measures can prevent major problems.

       <h5>1.7 Creating ID map</h5>
       <p>An ID map is an image that assigns a unique colour to each individual part of the mesh.<br> 
       This helps easily distinguish between different parts of the model and allows for more precise texturing.<br> 
       Once the ID map is created, I exported it along with my mesh to substance painter. In substance painter, I used the ID map as a guide to easily select and apply materials to specific parts of the model.<br> 
       This saved a lot of time and effort compared to manually selecting and applying materials to each individual part.

         <p>This process is essential, because it allowed me to achieve a high level of detail on my low poly model without adding unnecessary geometry. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The high poly map, I baked by used a Substance Paint software.<br>
It is a powerful tool for baking high poly maps, as it allows precise control over the details and easily transfers them onto the low poly model.<br> 
Here I demonstrate my baked maps. The bottom part is a low poly clay render.

       <h5>1.9 Texture Painting</h5>
         <p>Our dominant costume colour palette for the wizard lizard was carefully chosen by our art manager, whose keen eye for colour truly brought this character to life.<br>
         The final result is a beautiful and dynamic colour palette that captures the essence of the wizard lizard. 
         </p>
         <p>
             The green symbolises growth, balance, and harmony, which are all qualities associated with the wizard lizard. 
         </p>
         <p>
             The brown tones represent grounding and stability, as the character is wise and level-headed. The addition of gold adds a touch of regal and sophistication to the costume, emphasising the wizard lizard's status as a powerful and respected figure in the magical world. 
         </p>
         <p>
             We also added a purple colour for the amulet part behind the swirl. This shade will show the magical abilities and mystery.
         </p>
         <p>
             Overall, the colour palette of the wizard lizard's costume is a perfect reflection of his personality and abilities, making him a truly captivating and enchanting character in our story.

       <h5>2.0 Rigging</h5>
         <p>It was a bit time consuming, and at this stage I had issues without a proper solution.<br>
         Rigging is a crucial step in the 3D animation pipeline, as it allows realistic and fluid movement of characters and objects.<br>
         I created armatures, and then I joined the meshes to the bones with automatic weight.<br> 
         Once the rigging was complete, I had to test it by animating the character in various poses and movements.  Here came some issues. By moving arm bones, my hood mesh created strange deformations.<br> 
         I then started manually using weight paint. However, here is another issue. When I started painting, it also stretched my mesh.<br>
         I did not find an appropriate solution to overcome these issues. So, my decision was to separate the hood mesh from the bones. I then used proportional editing to make my hood mesh for my specific poses, as I had in my plan.

       <h5>2.1 Scene Creation</h5>
       <div class="scroll-object">
        <p>2.2.1 To enhance the visual appeal of my portfolio, I meticulously crafted a captivating cover image that displayed a wizard lizard. To generate ideas for the scene, I utilised artificial intelligence. After exploring various AI-generated images, I found several promising results. One particular image on the left-hand side stood out as a primary reference point. Guided by this inspiration, I attempted to create a similar scene that would captivate the viewer's attention.
        </p>
        <p>
        2.2.2 Through this scene, I aimed to highlight my skills in 3D modelling, lighting, and composition.<br>
        For the backdrop, I conjured towering mountains and illuminated the setting with an emission sphere light.<br> 
        The environment was further enriched with an abundance of rocks, multiplied using the array modifier. To add depth and intrigue, I incorporated various vegetation models, creating a lush and immersive atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
        At the heart of the scene, in the depths of an ancient cave adorned with menacing thorns, the mystical wizard lizard emerged from the darkness, his piercing gaze fixed upon a glowing orb. Flames danced around the orb, casting an ethereal glow upon the surroundings.<br> 
        To achieve the desired sharpness and realism, I meticulously simulated the fire, experimenting with various techniques to overcome the overly smooth edges encountered in Eevee rendering. Additionally, I created custom flame models, ensuring sharp edges from the middle fire that brought the flame to life. I also employed a particle system with emission to illuminate small lights within the scene.<br>
        However, despite my efforts, I encountered a minor setback with the particle system. The results did not fully meet my expectations, leading me to suspect a potential mistake in my implementation. In this case, I needed to work on this issue. 
        </p>
        <p>
        To capture an impactful image that highlights the captivating beauty of the wizard lizard, I meticulously adjusted the camera's settings. I ticked on the depth of field and decreased a distance. I was able to isolate the lizard as the primary subject, ensuring it stood out sharply against the backdrop.

       <h5>2.2 Lizard Final Look</h5>
        <p>Behold, the final renders of our adorable wizard lizard!<br> 
 I wanted to portray our wizard lizard as a powerful and wise creature, capable of casting spells and harnessing the forces of magic. In that case, I crafted additional elements.
</p>
<p>
 The orb in his hand represents his ability to control and manipulate magic, while the stick symbolises his connection to nature and deep understanding of the natural world.<br>
 The purple swirl symbol on the stick is a nod to his affinity for the mystical arts. 
</p>
<p>
    This is a creature that is both powerful and playful, ready to embark on magical adventures with his trusty companions. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with how our wizard lizard final looks, and I believe he will make a fantastic addition to the game.
