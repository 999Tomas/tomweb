                       The "Virtual Winchester" project, spearheaded by CEDI, is a pioneering initiative using 3D modelling with Unreal Engine to create an immersive digital experience of Winchester during the Jane Austen and Medieval (1400) periods. My primary role involved the creation of a historically accurate model of Winchester Castle. This process included extensive research, drawing upon online dimensions and historical sources, which was further enhanced by a visit to the Great Gate Museum, providing critical insight into the castle's architectural details. The project ultimately aims to bring the archaeological finds and artefacts to life, guided by historical figures within their accurate settings, offering an engaging and educational cultural heritage experience.

                    <p>
                        Winchester Castle, originally built in 1067, played a significant role in English history during the medieval period. By the 1400s, it had evolved into a prominent administrative and judicial centre. The Great Hall, constructed in the 13th century, was a key feature of the castle and served as a venue for important events and gatherings. During this time, the castle's architecture reflected the Gothic style, characterised by pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses  <a href="https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol5/pp9-12" target="_blank" class="no-style-link"> (Winchester Castle, 1912).</a> Understanding these historical elements was crucial in accurately modelling the castle for the "Virtual Winchester" project.

                        In my research, I utilised online sources, books, and a visit to the Winchester Great Gate Museum. I documented my findings using a Miro board and created a Pinterest board to organise visual references. This multi-faceted approach ensured a comprehensive understanding of Winchester Castle's architectural elements. Additionally, I contacted the Hampshire Cultural Trust to get more details about a printed model of Winchester Castle found at the Great Hall. Ignis Brennan-Laird, a Visitor Experience Assistant, provided valuable assistance by sending photographs of the model and recommending resources for further research. This included a book on the Great Hall's restoration work and suggestions for accessing additional information through the Hampshire Archives and the British Library.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        During the research phase, it became evident that the lack of comprehensive records and time constraints required a phased approach to the project. Initially, I decided to focus on the external structures, including the tower, entrance gate, and curtain wall. The client's initial mention influenced this decision, that if I encountered any problems or time constraints, I could complete the project in two parts. The second phase will cover the internal buildings, such as the King's Chapel and other structures.

                    <p class="scroll-object">
                        The accurate reconstruction of Winchester Castle's architectural elements, such as its towers, curtain walls, and other features, posed a significant challenge for this 3D modelling project. Initial attempts to model the towers, curtain walls, and other elements highlighted a lack of clarity, particularly regarding building heights. To address this, I consulted with my client, utilising additional material from English Heritage and other sources (Figure 3.2.1). A visit to the Great Hall, where a 3D model was displayed, proved valuable in understanding the tower shapes and layout (Figure 3.2.2). However, crucial details like arrow slits and crenellations remain unclear. Further research was necessary, so I contacted Hampshire Cultural Trust for details on the model used in the Great Hall, seeking information about its creator's source materials.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The north apex tower, partially excavated, provided the only precise measurement, with its diameter recorded as 12.8 meters <a href="https://ancientmonuments.uk/100240-winchester-castle-winchester-st-michael-ward" target="_blank" class="no-style-link"> (Ancient Monuments UK, n.d.).</a> I estimated the height at 16 meters, based on the fact that it was not taller than the Great Hall, which is 16.8 meters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Castle" target="_blank" class="no-style-link"> (Wikipedia, 2025)</a> (Figure 3.2.3).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Records indicated the south motte had a significant 'Great Tower', which was rebuilt in 1259-60 (HKW 860) (Figure 3.2.4). However, the exact size and location of this on the motte are unclear. While other tower dimensions remain uncertain, estimates suggest larger towers may reach 15-20 meters in diameter <a href="http://www.castlestudiesgroup.org.uk/CSG%20Journal%202019-2020rev7-Winchester%20Castle-lowres.pdf" target="_blank" class="no-style-link"> (Castles Studies Group, 2019).</a> Based on my visual scale and the Winchester Castle model found in the Great Hall, I decided to set the height of the largest tower on the south at approximately 21 meters. This decision was made to fit the historical context and provide a strategic advantage in defence and visibility. Additionally, other towers were designed to be higher than the North Apex tower.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The curtain walls were two meters thick and included a wall walk (Figure 3.2.5), as depicted in some illustrations and the Winchester Castle model in the Great Hall. The walls reached a height of nine meters, including crenellations, based on general knowledge of medieval defensive wall construction <a href="https://medievalbritain.com/type/medieval-life/architecture/parts-of-a-medieval-castle-the-curtain-wall/" target="_blank" class="no-style-link"> (Medieval Britain, n.d.).</a>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The design of the gate and portcullis was also a challenge, as no surviving details exist. I relied on historical research about such features in other medieval castles <a href="http://www.castlestudiesgroup.org.uk/CSGJournal2010-11X4Doors.pdf" target="_blank" class="no-style-link"> (Castles Studies Group, 2011)</a> to guide the reconstruction, following heritage records and architectural principles from the medieval period (Figure 3.2.6).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Records about Winchester Castle were difficult to find, as many have been lost over time. To fill in the gaps, I adopted elements from Windsor Castle, a castle of similar age and origin, for reference. This included details such as crenellations, arrow slits, narrow windows, and corbels <a href="https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/berks/vol3/pp29-56" target="_blank" class="no-style-link"> (British History Online, 1923</a>;  <a href="https://everycastle.com/windsor-castle/" target="_blank" class="no-style-link">EveryCastle.com, n.d.</a>)(Figure 3.2.7). William the Conqueror initiated both castles, supporting this decision.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While examining Winchester Castle's Great Hall, I noted buttresses supporting the wall (Figure 3.2.8). This detail, observed both on the castle model's curtain and in illustrations, will be incorporated into my 3D model for added structural accuracy.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        These efforts ensure that the 3D model of Winchester Castle is as historically accurate and detailed as possible, providing a valuable resource for understanding its architectural heritage.

                    Exploring cultural sites like the Winchester Great Hall provided valuable insights into the castle's architectural features and proportions. The hall housed a printed model of Winchester Castle, offering a detailed view of its structure and layout. However, there was no information about the creator of the model or the year of production. To learn more about the model, I contacted the Hampshire Cultural Trust, who provided photographs and additional information. A screenshot from my Miro board captures the details of this visit. This visit was instrumental in enhancing the accuracy and authenticity of my 3D model of Winchester Castle.

             <h5>6.1 Initial Concept & Blocking</h5>
            <p>
                My initial concept was to create a 3D model of Winchester Castle that reflects its architectural features during the medieval period. Inspired by historical texts, maps, and online sources, I aimed to capture the essence of the castle, acknowledging that some details are based on approximations due to limited historical records.
                <br>
                <br>
                To achieve this, I used AutoCAD to create accurate and precise base shapes, ensuring that my foundational layout was correctly scaled and aligned properly. I imported a 1400 Winchester map layout (Fig. 6.1.1) at a scale of 1:500 to determine the right shape of the castle area in AutoCAD. By following measurement records, I verified the scale was correct (Fig. 6.1.2). I then exported the file in DXF format and imported it into Blender (Fig. 6.1.3).
                <br>
                <br>
                In Blender, I began the blocking phase, focusing on establishing the basic shapes and proportions of the castle (Fig. 6.1.4). This blocking served as a preliminary framework for further detailed modelling and adjustments.

            <p class="scroll-object">
               The initial stages of recreating Winchester Castle were fraught with challenges. A lack of comprehensive castle records and conflicting interpretations, particularly regarding the shape of the towers, created significant hurdles.
               <br>
               <br>
               While sources documented a shift from square to circular towers during Henry III's reign, the evolution of the Motte towers, particularly those on the south side, was less clear. Although illustrations consistently depicted these towers as oval (Fig. 6.2.1), their accuracy remained questionable due to limited documentation on the transition from the original square designs <a href="http://www.castlestudiesgroup.org.uk/CSG%20Journal%202019-2020rev7-Winchester%20Castle-lowres.pdf" target="_blank" class="no-style-link"> (Castles Studies Group, 2019).</a> This discrepancy caused confusion and initial delays in the project. Following my tutor's suggestion, I visited the Great Hall, where a 3D model offered a structural layout (Fig. 6.2.2). However, the model further complicated the issue by portraying the eastern Motte towers as round, contrasting the oval shapes shown in the illustrations I initially used (Fig. 6.2.3). Additionally, the model represented a specific interpretation of the castle in 1258, and not necessarily an exact replica.
               <br>
               <br>
               To move forward and avoid losing more time, I decided to prioritise the Great Hall model as a more compelling reference. This led to blocking adjustments (Fig. 6.2.4), such as reducing tower heights, increasing wall heights, altering the D-shaped South Motte towers to round, and adding crenellations and buttresses, aligning with the model and broader research. A basic terrain model was also created to represent the castle's hill location.
               <br>
               <br>
               This iterative process of consulting various sources, incorporating feedback, and refining the model allowed me to move forward with greater confidence, resulting in a more accurate representation of Winchester Castle.

            <h5>6.3 Iterative Design Process</h5>
            <p>
                The iterative design process for the 3D model of Winchester Castle involved multiple stages of refinement to ensure historical accuracy and visual coherence. Initially, I created a base model using AutoCAD and Blender, focusing on the layout and proportions. However, discrepancies in historical records and visual references required several adjustments.
                <br>
                <br>
               One significant challenge was determining the accurate height of the south motte round towers and the oval towers on the eastern side. Initial estimates based on visual scale from the Great Hall model proved incorrect (Fig 6.3.1). After consulting with a colleague and reviewing additional photographs and references, I decided to reduce the height of these towers to better align with historical context and structural logic (Fig 6.3.2). This adjustment also required the removal of the last tower level's narrow windows to maintain architectural consistency.
               <br>
               <br>
               Throughout the process, I continuously refined the model, adjusting tower heights, wall dimensions, and architectural details such as crenellations and buttresses. The final model represents a synthesis of historical research, visual references, and iterative adjustments, resulting in a detailed and accurate representation of Winchester Castle.

            <p>
                Reflecting on this project, I realise how much I've learned and grown throughout the process. The journey of creating a historically accurate 3D model of Winchester Castle was both challenging and rewarding. Each stage, from initial research to final rendering, required meticulous attention to detail and deep understanding of medieval architecture. The iterative design process, with its numerous adjustments and refinements, taught me the importance of flexibility and perseverance.<br>
                My visit to the Great Gate Museum not only informed my work technically, but also reinforced the necessity of exploring real-world references to enhance digital outputs. In my future projects, I aim to incorporate early-stage site visits and professional consultations to avoid potential design pitfalls and ensure stunning accuracy in storytelling through 3D visualisation.

    "The Upper Ward's towers evolved from early 12th-century squares to round or oval forms (Castle Studies Group, 2019). While not definitively proven, I opted for round, inspired by Winchester Castle's Great Hall model.",
