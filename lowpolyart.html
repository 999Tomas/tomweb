            <h5>1.1 Inspirations</h5>
            <p>
                The task was to create an asset suitable for a game, while employing low poly modelling techniques. After careful consideration, I found the idea of a magical chest to be particularly compelling. Before I commenced the design process, I invested time in thorough research and preparation. I realised that my responsibilities extended beyond just modelling the chest; I would also need to animate it.
                <br>
                <br>
                To achieve the desired effect, I aimed to infuse the animation with elements of magic and mystique, ensuring that the chest remained both enchanting and relatable. This led me to conceptualise a chest containing ethereal souls, strengthening the narrative theme of liberation. The animation would not only highlight the chest’s mystical nature, but also deepen its story significance, ultimately creating a memorable asset that resonates within the environment.

            <h5>1.5 Sketching</h5>
            <p>
               The initial sketches provided a comprehensive breakdown of each component of the object, allowing me to visualise how these elements could be integrated into the final concept. This analytical approach enabled me to grasp the distinct parts that comprise the model, as well as their respective forms. Through this process, I was also able to identify the materials that would be utilised in the model.
            <br>
            <br>
                Following this, I conducted in-depth research, which informed the development of subsequent sketches. This research method served as a crucial building block for the model, streamlining the process of creating the 3D representations of the chest. Due to this structured drawing guide, I was able to clarify the specific requirements for the model's construction. Moreover, this preparatory work significantly reduced the likelihood of significant errors during the design phase in the 3D software, leading to a more efficient and effective modelling process.

            <img src="img/base-p3.png" style="">
            <p>
                In the initial phase of the chest base modeling process, I employed a cube primitive as the foundational shape. To achieve the correct proportions for the model, I scaled the cube along the x-axis. Next, while in edit mode, I introduced two loop cuts along the z-axis, followed by a scaling adjustment on the x-axis. This procedure was mirrored by adding additional loop cuts along the x-axis and scaling them along the z-axis. The result of these modifications effectively increased the polygon count of the mesh, which was necessary to facilitate the forthcoming extrusions.
                <br>
                <br>
                To define the overall volume of the model, I executed an extrusion downward from the top mid-surface. Additionally, to incorporate a recess around the mid-faces on all sides, I performed inward extrusions. By referencing a detailed guide, I then created outward extrusions on the corner faces, both at the top and bottom. This strategic combination of techniques ensured a well-structured and visually accurate representation of the chest base.

            <h5>2.2 Lid Modelling</h5>
            <img src="img/lid-p3.png" style=";">
            <p>
               The process of modelling the lid began with duplicating the top faces of the base mesh, after which I separated the duplicated section to create a distinct mesh. To form the bottom part of the lid, I extruded this mesh upward, establishing a solid foundation. For the top lid section, I strategically copied the middle top edges of the newly created bottom lid and scaled them outward before separating them from the initial geometry. This approach was intentional, as it allowed for future solidification of the mesh without unnecessarily increasing the polygon count in a region that already possessed adequate thickness. My focus throughout this modelling process was to maintain a low poly count while ensuring structural integrity.
               <br>
               <br>
               After establishing the initial shapes, I proceeded to define the height by extruding the edges upward and filling in the resulting faces. I employed the bevel tool (shortcut: Ctrl+B) on the top edges to create a rounded appearance, closely following my reference images. To accommodate further extrusions, I increased the polygon count by adding two loop cuts to the bevelled surface, followed by inserting faces on both sides of the mesh. This step was essential for achieving the desired form and detail. Subsequently, I extruded the top middle faces and the centre faces of both sides inward, which significantly contributed to the dimensionality of the lid. To enhance the lid's thickness, I applied the solidify modifier. Finally, I refined the model further by pushing the top centre faces upward on both sides. After that, I joined the bottom part with the top, completing the lid modelling process.

                Lid Deformation
            </p>
            <p>
                To enhance the visual appeal of my model, I applied a series of deformation techniques to the mesh of the lid. Initially, I selected a random assortment of vertices on the cover mesh and utilised the grab tool to reposition them in various directions, creating a more dynamic and organic appearance. Additionally, I focused on the bottom front face of the lid, where I implemented the knife cut tool to create several slices. Following this, I used the grab tool again to manipulate the resulting edges by moving them both upward and downward, as well as slightly inward. This combination of techniques resulted in a more intricate and engaging design, contributing to the complexity of the model.

            <p>
                For the base of the model, I focused on adding more loop cuts to increase the mesh's polygon density, which provides greater flexibility during deformation. To achieve a more stylised form, I transformed the base by scaling it inward along the X-axis, while utilising the proportional editing feature. This method enabled me to maintain a natural flow in the geometry of the mesh. I carefully selected and manipulated both the edge pieces on each side, as well as the bottom corner faces, allowing for a cohesive transformation that not only enhanced the aesthetic, but also improved the structural integrity of the model.

This smoothing technique significantly improved the appearance of the model by softening harsh angles and providing a more refined surface finish. The result is a cohesive and polished model that showcases the intricacies of the deformation techniques employed.

            <h5>2.4 Lock Modelling</h5>
            <p>
                In this section, I utilised a primitive cube as the base for the lock model. Initially, I scaled the cube along the x-axis and then the y-axis to achieve the correct dimensions. To add a refined touch, I bevelled the top edge corners of the cube. As I began to refine the front face, I encountered an issue where the bevel tool resulted in N-gon on both the front and back faces. This prevented me from adding loop cuts, which are essential for further manipulation. To rectify this, I converted the N-gon into quads by connecting the vertices through strategically placed edges. Once I established quads on both faces, I added the necessary loop cuts. Prior to executing the extrusion operations, I utilised proportional editing to scale the bottom and mid-vertices inward along the x-axis, adhering closely to my reference image. The first step in the extrusion process was to extrude the two top faces. Following this, I added an additional loop cut to the newly extruded bottom face, and then pushed this face outward to achieve the desired form. To finalise the design, I bevelled both the top and bottom edges, enhancing the visual appeal of the lock.

            <h5>2.5 Lock Hole Creation</h5>
            <p>
                For the lock hole, I started with a cylinder mesh, which I scaled appropriately. From this base, I extruded three of the bottom mid-faces downward and introduced a loop cut at the centre face of this extrusion. This added two additional vertices, allowing further manipulation. Using proportional editing, I repositioned these vertices downward until the shape resembled a practical lock hole. With the hole shape established, I made the first part of my lock model visible and selected it, after which I applied the Boolean modifier. I used the eyedropper tool to select the lock hole mesh as the target for the Boolean operation. Utilising the difference operation, this step successfully carved the lock hole into the main mesh. To ensure the integrity of the model during movement, I needed to apply the Boolean modifier before finalising the design. After applying the modifier, I removed the lock hole mesh, as it was no longer necessary for the final model.

            <h5>2.6 Handle Modelling</h5>
            <p>
                The handle of the lock was constructed using both a cube and a curve. The cube served as the foundation for the top part of the handle, where adjustments were minimal. I simply scaled the cube to achieve the required proportions. For the finger pull section, I opted to use a curve, which I scaled along the x-axis to fit the intended design. The curve consists of five vertices. I manipulated these by selecting the two end vertices and scaling them inward, while also adjusting the centre vertex downward and the adjacent vertices upward to create a straight line. To enhance the geometry, I accessed the object properties and increased the depth of the bevel on the curve. As the curve was initially not a mesh, I converted it to a mesh before merging it with the top part of the handle. Given my design included two handles, I employed a mirror modifier to create symmetry. Before applying the mirror modifier, I ensured the location of the model was applied to maintain alignment throughout the modelling process.

                The handle of the lock was constructed using both a cube and a curve. The cube served as the foundation for the top part of the handle, where adjustments were minimal. I simply scaled the cube to achieve the required proportions. For the finger pull section, I opted to use a curve, which I scaled along the x-axis to fit the intended design. The curve consists of five vertices. I manipulated these by selecting the two end vertices and scaling them inward, while also adjusting the centre vertex downward and the adjacent vertices upward to create a straight line. To enhance the geometry, I accessed the object properties and increased the depth of the bevel on the curve. As the curve was initially not a mesh, I converted it to a mesh before merging it with the top part of the handle. Given my design included two handles, I employed a mirror modifier to create symmetry. Before applying the mirror modifier, I ensured the location of the model was applied to maintain alignment throughout the modelling process.

                <p>
                    In my chest model, I employed texture painting techniques to enhance the metal components, including the lock, handle, and decorative cylindrical elements. Every outward extrusion on both the chest base and the cover mesh was meticulously painted to add depth and realism. For the main mesh and cover, I utilised PBR (Physically Based Rendering) textures to create the wooden sections, ensuring high realism throughout the model.

            <h5>3.1 UVM & PBR Textures with Texture Painting</h5>
            <p>
                To begin the process of texture painting, I unwrapped my mesh in edit mode by selecting all elements using the shortcut key A. For this project, I opted for the Smart UV Project, which automates the unwrapping process and generates a 2D UV map from my 3D mesh. This unwrapped map serves as a canvas for seamlessly applying textures to my model.
                <br>
                <br>
                Next, I switched to Object Interaction Mode by pressing Ctrl+Tab and selected the Texture Paint workspace. In the Active Tool settings, I opted to create a new texture, setting its resolution to 1024. This resolution is sufficient for my low-poly model, allowing quicker rendering times while maintaining acceptable texture quality. I designated a brown colour for the primary texture, which corresponds to the chest metal section of my model.
            </p>

                Metal
            </p>
            <p>
                During the shading phase, I noticed discrepancies in the shading of the metal cover compared to the base model. The final render showcased a lighter hue on the metal section, leading to challenges in achieving consistency in shading across different areas. Although I attempted to camouflage these differences using scene lighting, the transparent background highlighted the inconsistencies. Fortunately, in the animation context, certain angles effectively masked these imperfections. The dark atmosphere, complemented by smoke effects and volumetric lighting, as well as blue emissive particle models, obscured the errors, creating a satisfactory visual result in motion.

                Wooden
            </p>
            <p>
                For the wooden part of the model, I implemented a Physically Based Rendering (PBR) texture, which enhances the realism of the wood surface. Initially, I introduced a ColorRamp node and a selection of colours to establish a base for the wood texture. I created a simple procedural shader using a single Musgrave texture generator, duplicated it, and stacked the two for greater complexity.
                <br>
                To facilitate consistent texturing across models, I selected the duplicated Musgrave texture and pressed Ctrl+T to add a Mapping node along with a Texture Coordinate node. I modified the output connections from 'Generated' to 'Object' to ensure that the texture remained uniform across various objects. I then adjusted the scaling of the pattern to achieve a horizontal wood grain effect by reducing the scale on both the X and Y axes to 0.1, while increasing the Z-axis scale to 2.0.
            </p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/c-nogr.shiny.png" style="width:50%">
            <p>
                Subsequently, I integrated another ColorRamp node and a Bump node into the shader network. By connecting the ColorRamp to the bump height input and the Bump node to the normal input of the Principled BSDF shader, I aimed to create a groove pattern effect. I applied an invert function to the bump settings, since the initial results were overly pronounced. Therefore, I adjusted the bump strength until I achieved a more aesthetically pleasing texture.
            </p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/t-fixed.png" style="width:30%">
            <img src="img/c-fixed.png" style="width:80%">
            <p>
                After completing these adjustments, I realised the wood texture appeared excessively shiny. To rectify this, I added another ColorRamp node connected to the Musgrave texture and linked the ColorRamp colour output to the roughness input of the Principled BSDF shader. Finally, I swapped the black and white stops within the ColorRamp, effectively resolving the shininess issue and resulting in a more realistic wooden texture.

               In the opening slide, I showcase an X-ray view screenshot that provides insight into the spatial arrangements within the scene, allowing viewers to appreciate the meticulous layout of each asset. The subsequent slide features a top-down view of my initial render, where I introduce a rustic wooden shack characterized by intentionally large gaps between its planks. This design choice is deliberate, as it allows the enchanted environment beyond the shack to subtly emerge, inviting viewers to engage with the mysterious atmosphere that underpins the narrative.
               <br>
               <br>
               For the background, I utilised an alpha channel image, with RGB curves linked to an emission shader, creating a vibrant and immersive backdrop.<br> 
               Surrounding the magical chest, I strategically placed the scene assets discussed earlier, ensuring their placement enhances the composition.<br> The lighting setup features three carefully positioned point lights, each tuned to a subtle power output that fosters an atmosphere of intrigue and suspense. I employed volumetric cone lighting to cast dramatic rays of light, which create striking shadows and highlights that enhance the visual complexity.
               <br>
               <br>
               To further enrich the mystical ambiance, I incorporated a smoke simulation alongside particle effects that symbolise souls, which manifest at the moment the magical chest is opened. This thoughtful combination of elements is designed to evoke a sense of wonder and intrigue, drawing viewers into the narrative, while allowing them to explore the thematic depths of mystery and liberation woven throughout the scene.

                <h1>Animation</h1>
                <p>
                    In this section, I will discuss three distinct animations that showcase various techniques used in Blender. The first animation illustrates the theme of liberation, where the chest lid opens and souls emerge from within. I developed this animation by creatively blending environment renders within Blender's video editing suite.<br>The second animation focuses on the rotational movement of the chest lid. Lastly, the turntable animation offers a 360-degree view of the chest model, emphasising its detailed design.
                    <br>

                <h5 id="content-soulsreleased-p3">4.1 Souls Released: Chest Animation within a Mystical Environment</h5>
                <p>
                    To begin, I incorporated an empty object in my scene and applied a constraint to my camera, targeting it towards this empty object. I initiated my animation workflow by selecting the camera and pressing 'I' to set my first key frame at frame 1 on the timeline, marking the initial position. Next, I extended the timeline to 250 frames and made slight adjustments to the camera's position, before hitting 'I' again to create a second key frame, effectively capturing the desired movement.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In terms of the physics aspects of my animation, I manipulated the smoke and particle properties to align with the narrative of the chest opening. The smoke and particle effects were configured to initiate once the lid begins to lift, enhancing the dramatic reveal of the souls visually represented within the chest. However, I encountered a challenge: the particles representing the souls moved at an excessively high speed, leading to an unintended visual result. This miscalculation stemmed from both my desire to expedite the process and a lack of comprehensive knowledge regarding the settings.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Reproducing this animation required minimal time, although the rendering process was considerably time-consuming due to the numerous effects, volume textures, and lighting adjustments involved.

            <p>
               In this segment, I focused on crafting a realistic animation of the chest lid. First, I entered edit mode, selected the lid, and identified the starting and ending edges at the back. I positioned the 3D cursor at the pivot point for the lid to create a believable swinging motion. After selecting the lid, I pressed 'I' in the transform panel to insert a key frame for the rotation. Then, I adjusted the Y-axis to a full 360 degrees for a complete rotation, before setting another key frame to capture this movement.

            <video src="videos/c-turntable.webm" autoplay muted></video>
            <p>
               The final part of my project involved a turntable animation of the chest model itself. I began by adding an empty object and selecting the chest model to set it as the active element. Using the shortcut Ctrl + P, I established a parent-child relationship between the model and the empty object. I then set an initial key frame at frame one, and after advancing to the final frame of the timeline, I adjusted the Z rotation to 360 degrees and inserted a second key frame.
               <br>
               <br>
               Initially, this animation adopted a Bezier interpolation, resulting in an uneven speed that slowed towards the end. To rectify this, I changed the interpolation type to linear by using the shortcut Ctrl + T, achieving a uniform rotation speed throughout the animation. This meticulous attention to detail allowed the low poly chest model to effectively showcase its sculpted intricacies.
