            <h5>1 Introduction to Project</h5>
            <p class="scroll-object">
                I have always been fascinated by the art and science of architecture, the way it blends form and function to create structures that not only serve a purpose, but also leave a lasting impression on those who experience them.
                <br>
                <br>
                This semester, I have delved into architecture. I wanted to learn about the intricate process of creating these structures. To understand the various stages involved in the architectural process, from conceptualisation and design to construction and implementation.
                <br>
                <br>
                One of my main goals for this semester was to improve my CAD skills. CAD software is an essential tool in architecture, and I wanted to better understand its capabilities and how to use it effectively.
                <br> 
                This project I was attracted to developing is the brief the “Caring Culture.”
                <br>
                Through this project, I hope to improve the lives of older adults by providing them with a comfortable and affordable home, as well as a supportive community where they can thrive and enjoy their golden years. 'New Beginning' is not just a physical structure, but a symbol of hope and a better quality of life for our seniors. With this project, we can create a caring culture where older adults are valued and supported, and their contributions to society are recognised and appreciated. It is a small step towards a bigger goal of creating a society where everyone, regardless of age, can lead a fulfilling and dignified life.
                <br>
                <br>
                The idea is a mobile container home that could be easily transported and set up in other community locations.
                <br>
                The design of the container house is simple and practical, with a focus on accessibility and comfort for older adults. The interior is spacious and open, with wide doorways to accommodate mobility aids.
                <br> 
                Outside, the foldable porch provides space for relaxation and enjoying the surrounding nature. The green roof not only adds to the aesthetic appeal of the house, but also helps with insulation and reducing energy costs.
                <br> 
                But "New Beginning" is not just about providing affordable and accessible housing for older adults. It also aims to create a sense of community and support for residents. The retirement container houses are located close together, allowing social interactions and shared activities among the residents. There is also a community centre that offers various services, such as health check-ups, social events, and educational programs.
                <br> 
                The container house model incorporates several unique features, one of which is a foldable porch. This porch provides a versatile outdoor space that can be easily expanded.
                <br>
                <br>
                My model boasts two terraces, each with sliding WPC frame construction windows. These terraces are the perfect place to unwind and take in the surrounding views. With these unique features, my model offers a perfect balance of indoor comfort and outdoor connection, making it an ideal living space for seniors.
                <br>
                <br>
                The video shows the seamless process of how these parts can be extended, and how the result looks with added textures. The realistic animation and final render give a glimpse into how the model would look in real life, providing a clear understanding of the design and its potential.

        <div class="item item-text">
            <h5>1.1 Why Containers?</h5>
            <p>
                Container houses can be customised and designed to fit the specific needs and preferences of the occupant. This is especially helpful for seniors who may have mobility or accessibility issues. They can have a home tailored to their needs, making it easier for them to navigate and live comfortably. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Apart from the practical benefits, container houses also have a unique and modern aesthetic. They can be designed in various styles and look like traditional houses. Container houses offer a sustainable, affordable, and customizable housing option that can greatly improve the quality of life for seniors. They are a solution to the increasing cost of living and the growing concern for the environment.

            <h5>1.2 Primary Target Audience Research | Paper Survey</h5>
            <p class="scroll-object">
                Undertaking this survey was a challenging task for me, especially since my target audience was older adults.
                <br>
                As I delved into my research, I came to the realisation that many individuals in this age group do not use the internet, making it difficult for me to conduct an online survey. With my tutor's guidance, I decided to take to the streets to gather my primary research. However, I soon discovered that this group of individuals were not keen on participating in surveys. While they were friendly and willing to engage in conversation, they were reluctant to answer my questionnaire.
                <br>
                I had to come up with an alternative plan, I interviewed people in the library in the supermarket and at the railway station.  In total, I managed to gather 23 participants, which was a significant accomplishment considering the challenges I faced.
                <br>
                This survey was not only time-consuming, but also required a lot of effort to convince older adults to participate. However, it was worth it, as their opinions and perspectives are crucial in my research. Overall, this survey was a valuable experience that not only provided me with valuable data for my research, but also deepened my understanding of the needs and behaviours of the senior citizens.
                <br>
                <br>
                I asked their opinions, what they thought about container houses, whether they felt it is a feasible option for living in. If they could see themselves living in one. What they liked and disliked about the mock up test I had created.
                <br>
                <br>
                [1.2.1] Statistics show 69% of people believe a container house is suitable for living in, while 22% are unsure and 9% do not think it is a viable option. With a high percentage of them thinking positively about container houses, it is truly gratifying. This statistic is proof that perhaps the older generation is more open-minded and willing to consider alternative options for their housing needs.
                <br>
                <br>
                [1.2.2] The responses to the Display about the idea of living in a container house included: 44% of respondents expressed openness to the idea, while 52% stated they were gravitating towards a 'yes' response. The numbers indicate that most seniors are intrigued by the idea of living in a container house.
                <br>
                From my sample it appears to prove that they are open to the idea of living in a container house.
                <br>
                <br>
                [1.2.3] From the Display data gathered from the participants. It is clear that most of them are interested in homes with 2-3 bedrooms.
                <br>
                This finding is crucial, as it directly impacts on the design and development of the one-bedroom container house prototype I have been working on. Knowing that my target audience prefer homes with 2-3 bedrooms, I can now focus on creating a design that caters to their needs and preferences.
                <br>
                <br>
                The last two questions that were multiple choice eliciting responses in my survey have been incredibly beneficial in helping me come up with ideas for my new container house prototype.<br>
                I gained valuable insights into what my target audience dislikes about my primary mock up design.
                <br>
                <br>
                [1.2.4] The results showed 86% of my target audience found the house too small, while an overwhelming 91% did not like the concept of a roof terrace. Additionally, 52% of the participants disliked the colours used in the design. These findings have given me valuable insight into areas that require more attention and improvement in my model. It has also helped me understand the preferences and expectations of my target audience, allowing me to make necessary changes and modifications to my prototype.
                <br>
                <br>
                [1.2.5] The final question in my research focused on the participants' wishes and preferences in housing.
                <br>
                100% of my participants agreed with two key factors: the importance of low price and energy efficiency in their ideal home. This shows a clear trend towards more practical and sustainable living choices.
                <br>
                Additionally, 96% of participants expressed a desire for the threshold at the entrance to be level, with no steps, making it easier for individuals with mobility issues or disabilities to enter and exit the home.
                <br>  
                The majority, 91%, also emphasised the importance of having an accessible bathroom and incorporating renewable energy sources into the home.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another aspect that was highly valued by 91% of the participants was the need for ample space and flexibility in their ideal home.
                <br>
                It was also interesting to note that a green environment was important to 87% of participants, further highlighting the growing awareness and importance of environmental sustainability.
                <br>
                Additionally, 83% of the participants expressed a need for sufficient storage space and a porch, which are both practical and desirable features in a home.
                <br>
                <br>
                Hearing these responses from my participants was enlightening, as many of these factors had not crossed my mind during the initial stages of my research. It shows the importance of considering the perspectives and preferences of those who will live in new homes when designing and building them. Overall, the unanimous wishes and desires of my participants regarding housing serve as valuable insight and highlight the need for practicality, sustainability, and inclusivity in housing design.

            <h5>1.3 Containers | Secondary Research</h5>
            <p class="scroll-object">
                [1.3.1] Secondary research has been crucial in the development of my container project. This included exploring various container sizes and their placement within a space to effectively optimise the use of space.
                <br>
                [1.3.2] I also delved into the world of container homes by studying various visual examples that exist. For example, container City in London at Trinity Buoy Wharf E14. Which is largely been created by artists and designers. My goal is to create a unique and functional home, I carefully selected the design elements that would make my container project stand out.
                <br>
                <br>
                [1.3.3] I explored a wide range of materials suitable for use in a container home, taking into consideration factors such as durability, sustainability, and cost. Through this research, I discovered the endless possibilities that come with using recycled materials, which aligns with my goal of creating an environmentally friendly project.
                <br>
                <br>
                [1.3.4] Another important aspect of my research was understanding how containers connect. This provided me with valuable insights into the different methods and costs involved, allowing me to make well-informed decisions for my project.
                <br>
                In conclusion, secondary research has allowed me to understand the needs and preferences of my target group, explore various design options, and make informed decisions on materials and methods.

            <p class="scroll-object">
                The installation of ceiling heating. This heating system not only provides thermal comfort, but also helps save energy costs.
                <br>
                In addition to the main living space, the container house will also have a manually extendable porch that can be mounted on the container wall. This porch will provide a comfortable outdoor seating area for the residents, allowing them to enjoy the front of their home and interact with their neighbours.
                <br>
                <br>
                The offset configuration of the containers also allows the creation of two terraces. One will be located off the master bedroom and another from the dining area. It provides a perfect spot for relaxing and enjoying the surrounding nature.
                <br>
                <br>
                To make the container house stand out and have a unique design, the idea is to incorporate a sliding WPC planks frame construction with narrow windows. This design not only adds visual interest, but also serves a functional purpose. The frame will function as a roof for the terraces, providing protection from the rain, while the vertical construction will block the strong south wind. The other open sides of the terraces allow for a connection to the environment and provide a sense of openness and freedom.
                <br>
                <br>
                Next part is a roof. I chose a green shed type of roof.
                <br> 
                This type of roof has a single slope, making it easy to build and maintain. Additionally, the slope of the roof allows rainwater and snow to easily run off, reducing the risk of leaks and damage.
                <br>
                <br>
                A green roof, also known as a living roof, is a roof partially or completely covered with vegetation. A green roof is an environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and visually appealing option for the roof of a container house. It has numerous benefits, such as energy efficiency, roof protection, flood prevention, and biodiversity support. It is a great way to transform a simple container house into a sustainable and beautiful home.
                <br>
                <br>
                Solar panels are a great option for a container house because they are low maintenance, have a long lifespan, and can save seniors energy costs.
                <br>
                <br>
                By incorporating a living shed roof with a solar panel system, the container house will not only have a unique and visually appealing design but will also stand out as a symbol to be energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.

            <h5>1.5 Sketching</h5>
            <p class="scroll-object">
               [1.5.1] My annotated drawing reflects my research and ideas that I have gathered through both primary and secondary sources.
               <br>
               In this drawing, I have combined hand-drawn elements, generated AI images and sketches, and a quick model rendered with textures to add depth and dimension to the composition.
               <br>
               It gives the viewer a glimpse into what the final product could potentially look like in a physical form.
               <br>
               The annotated notes serve as a guide, providing insight into my thought process and the various elements that make up the drawing.
               <br>
               Overall, my goal with this drawing was to create a visually interesting piece that highlights my versatility as an artist and my ability to combine different techniques.
               <br>
               <br>
               [1.5.2] My rough floor plan sketch for this specific design features an offset configuration, providing a unique and functional layout that allows for the creation of a spacious master bedroom with an ensuite.
               <br>
               The offset design lends itself to a more open and airier feel.
               <br>
               <br>
               The master bedroom is strategically placed at one end of the house, providing privacy and a sense of seclusion from the rest of the living spaces. The ensuite, located within the master bedroom, offers convenience and luxury.
               <br>
               I added a small office table in the bedrooms, which allows for a designated workspace. This will make it easy for seniors to stay organised and on top of important tasks.
               <br>
               The open concept living, dining, and kitchen area not only allows easy mobility, but also encourages socialisation and entertaining.
               <br>
               I created large windows in the dining-living area that provide ample natural light, making the space feel bright and airy.
               <br>
               The offset configuration allowed me to create two outdoor patios. It provides a perfect place for seniors to relax and enjoy fresh air.
               <br>
               <br>
               Overall, with this floor plan, I consider the needs and desires of seniors, providing a functional, practical, and aesthetically pleasing living space.
               <br>
               I think this layout truly has everything the older adults could desire.
               <br>
               <br>
               [1.5.3] The south elevation of my container home model sketch showcases all the design elements that I have carefully incorporated into this project.
               <br>
               The one of the most prominent features is the green shed roof, which adds a touch of nature and sustainability to the design. I believe that incorporating elements of nature in architecture is not only aesthetically pleasing, but also essential for the well-being of our planet.
               <br> 
               The foldable porch is another unique addition to the container, providing a versatile outdoor space.
               <br>
               <br>
               My last design detail is a large sliding WPC planks frame construction with narrow windows. This is a key design element that not only adds visual interest to the building, but also serves a practical purpose.
               <br>
               With this final sketch, I am confident that my design not only meets the functional needs, but also creates a visually appealing and sustainable living space.
               <br>
               <br>
               [1.5.4] The 3D front view sketch and the top view sketches of the porch components. The annotations on the sketches indicate the specific parts and functions, which most of them are explained in the first sketch.
               <br>
               The main elements of this porch include a deck, canopy support and canopy.
               <br>
               WPC is my dominant material of the porch parts. I chose it because it has numerous advantages. Its durability, resistance to weather and pests, eco-friendliness, ease of installation, and cost-effectiveness.
               <br>
               By using this material, it aligns with the sustainable and eco-conscious approach of the design.
               <br>
               <br>
               The deck, which is an essential part of any porch, in my plan should be made of WPC tiles. This material offers the perfect balance of durability and aesthetics. It is an ideal choice for outdoor spaces.
               <br>
               <br>
               Moving on to the canopy, I have opted for a combination of WPC planks and steel for its support structure. This combination ensures the strength and durability of the canopy, while also adding a modern touch to the overall design. The canopy itself would be designed with WPC planks. To add an extra touch of elegance, I will incorporate glass panels into the canopy, allowing natural light to filter through and creating a beautiful play of light and shadows.
               <br>
               I also added a LED light strip to the canopy, it will provide a warm and inviting ambiance for the evening. The integration of these lights will also add to the modern and sophisticated feel of the porch.
               <br>
               <br>
               [1.5.5] This is a floor plan by using Room Sketcher software. Using Room Sketcher was a seamless and enjoyable experience. The software not only helped me bring my rough sketch floor plan to life, but also allowed me to experiment with different layouts and designs. It was a valuable tool that provided me with a fast and visualizable way to plan out my space. 
               <br>
               <br>
               With Room Sketcher, I experimented with different layouts and configurations until I found the perfect one for my container house project. Here are my screenshots.
               <br>
               <br>
               [1.5.7] The side-by-side configuration of these homes creates a spacious and open living area, perfect for hosting guests and entertaining. The open concept design of the dining room, living room, and kitchen allows seamless flow between these spaces.
               <br>
               [1.5.6] & [1.5.7] The downside of both layouts is that the master bedroom is without an ensuite, and it may also not offer as much privacy as other configurations.
               <br>
               <br>
               [1.5.8] I am happy with this layout, as it maximises the use of space and provides all the necessary areas for a comfortable and functional living experience. Additionally, this offset configuration allowed to create a comfortable and private master bedroom with an ensuite. This was my goal!
               <br>
               Another advantage of the offset configurations was the creation of two spacious terrace decks.
               <br>
               Having terrace decks for seniors is a wonderful addition, providing them with a peaceful and enjoyable outdoor space. It will be a great place for them to gather with friends and family for outdoor gatherings and provide a safe and secure environment to exercise and stay active.<br>
               This is why I ultimately decided on this configuration.
               <br>
               <br>
               [1.5.9] This is my sketches at the start of the project. It is a single 40ft container house floor plan and top perspective view.
               <br>
               At the beginning, I did lack research. I did not know my target audience needs, and preferences. I started planning this small layout container home. My primary statistic shows this design is too small for them, it may serve the needs of a young single person, but it is not comfortable for older ages.
               <br>
               <br>
               I realised that I needed to take a step back and do proper research before jumping into the design process.
               <br>
               Through my primary research and secondary research, I not only improved the functionality of the design, but also made it a more comfortable and welcoming space for seniors to live in.
               <br>
               <br>
                This experience taught me the importance of thorough research and understanding the needs of my target audience before diving into a project. It also showed me the value of being open to feedback and making necessary changes to create a design that truly meets the needs of the end user.

                This is a floorplan which I made by following my rough sketch plan.
                <br>
                The floor plan is a crucial element in the design of any space, as it determines the layout and flow of the room.
                <br> 
                The goal of this project was to create a safe and comfortable living environment for seniors, thus I made sure to consider the functionality and practicality of the space.
                <br>
                It required a lot of concentration and attention to detail, as even a small mistake could throw off the entire design.
                <br> 
                One of the main challenges I faced during this stage was to ensure space for mobility equipment.
                <br>
                So, this challenge was in the main bedroom. There was a lack of space functionality to move with mobility aids to the terrace. In that case, I decided to incorporate the smaller bed into the master bedroom.

            <h5>1.9 Foldable Porch</h5>
            <p class="scroll-object">
                One of the most innovative and practical features of this container home design is the folding porch. This concept takes into consideration the occupants needs, whether it be travel, or a lifestyle. The porch is designed to be easily transported along with the rest of the container home and won't need to be dismantled every time. This will save time and effort, but also adds to the convenience and functionality of the container home.
                <br>
                <br>
                The porch is attached to the front of the container home and can be easily folded up or down.
                <br>
                The views on the right side of the cad drawing show how the porch can be unfolded outwards.
                <br>
                The non-unfolded elevations and top views on the left side of the cad drawing, demonstrates how the porch is in its folded down position. I gave detailed cad drawings of how it would look when it was deliverable or transportable.
                <br>
                <br>
                The porch folding mechanism is a series of hinges that allow easy folding and unfolding. These hinges are strategically placed to ensure stability and durability, while also allowing smooth and effortless movement
                <br>
                <br>
                One of the major advantages of this folding porch design is its ease of use. The simple folding mechanism requires minimal physical effort, it would be accessible for those with mobility issues or limited strength.
                <br>
                I also added the animation below to the cad drawing, which gives a visual representation of how the porch would be easily unfolded.
                <br>
                The folding porch for the container home will not only add to the design and aesthetic of the home but will also be useful for those seniors who frequently want to change community locations.

            <h5>2.0 Elevations</h5>
            <p>
                It was a challenging process when it came to designing the elevations of the facade.
                <br>
                The elevations of a building are an essential aspect of the design process, as they need to provide a detailed representation of the exterior of the structure.
                <br>
                I had to consider the creation of a large terrace sliding WPC planks frame construction with narrow windows. It required careful planning and consideration. This part of the creation used the most time. Overall, I found the process challenging.
                <br>
                Questions arose, such as how the frame would slide, what mechanism would be used, and where it would be mounted. It took me time to come up with a solution. 
                <br>
                The elevation drawings played a crucial role in the creation of my 3D model container house project. They allowed me to envision and plan every detail of the exterior, from the roof to the finishes.
                <br>
                These plans helped me accurately depict the size and dimensions of the building, allowing me to create a realistic and precise model.
                <br> 
                It was a rewarding process that required precision, creativity, and attention to detail.

        <div class="item item-text">
            <h5>2.1 Choosing Colour Palette</h5>
            <p>
                My container house model is a unique and modern structure that exudes warmth and tranquillity with its dominant colours of cherry wood and light shade of yellow. These hues create a harmonious and inviting atmosphere that is both stylish and comforting. The cherry wood colour, with its deep and rich tones, gives a sense of elegance and sophistication to the exterior of the house.
                <br>
                <br>
                The light shade of yellow was chosen, to complement the cherry wood and add a touch of brightness and positivity to the overall design. Yellow is often associated with happiness and joy, and by incorporating it into the exterior of the container house, it conveys optimism and positivity. This is especially important for seniors, who may transition into a new phase of their lives and need a boost of energy and enthusiasm.
                <br>
                The other three specific colours were generated using the Colormind.io scheme generator. The first colour, sandstone, was chosen for the decking, entrance door.
                <br> 
                The second colour, alligator skin, was selected for the canopy support steel component.
                <br>
                <br>
                The third colour, olive green, was chosen for the cladding of the roof sides.
                <br>
                Together, all these colours create a well-balanced and cohesive colour scheme for this container house model.
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall, the exterior of this container house is designed to convey a sense of warmth, optimism, and joy. It is a place where seniors can feel comfortable, happy, and at peace.

            <h5>2.3 Final Render</h5>
            <p>
               The background scenary, I created in Photoshop. I rendered some of the objects separately in ''blender'' and then assembled them in ''Photoshop''. 
               <br> 
               This decision was made to save time.<br> 
               For the first render (see Figure 2.3.1), I incorporated HDRI day lighting to create a vibrant and energetic atmosphere. I chose a bright and sunny HDRI map to enhance the contrast between light and shadow in the scene.
               The trees were introduced to create a sense of nature and tranquillity.
               <br>
               I wanted to convey the message that a healthy and active lifestyle is important for seniors, and being surrounded by nature can have a positive impact on their well-being.
               <br>
               <br>
               In contrast, the second render (see Figure 2.3.2) utilised HDRI night lighting, resulting in a more peaceful and calming ambiance. I used a dark and starry HDRI map to create a sense of serenity and relaxation.
               <br> 
               I also turned on the created lights of the container house, symbolising the warmth and comfort of a home.
               <br>
               This render emphasises the importance of a peaceful and comfortable living environment for seniors.
               <br>
               <br>
               Both renders were created with a lot of attention to detail. I wanted to showcase the beauty of nature and how it can be incorporated into our living spaces to create a healthier and more fulfilling lifestyle for seniors. These renders represent my passion for 3D design and my belief in the power of design to positively impact people's lives.

            <p>
                The video I have created aims to effectively demonstrate my idea for a new and innovative container house design.
                <br>
                The use of two lorries in the animation emphasises the transportability and delivery of the model.
                <br>
                It showcases the functionality of the additional parts and how they can be easily unfolded, as well as demonstrating how a large terrace window is also sliding.

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>
                A challenging yet fulfilling journey that allowed me to improve my skills, but also gain a better understanding of the needs of older adults.
                <br>
                Through this project, I was able to identify my mistakes and areas where I need to work on further, which will only help me grow and become a better designer. I hope to continue working towards creating a more inclusive and supportive society for all individuals, especially our senior citizens, through effective design.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have learned different techniques and shortcuts to create detailed and accurate drawings. I have also learned the importance of precision and attention to detail when it comes to CAD drawings, as even the smallest error can have a significant impact on the design.
                <br>
                Furthermore, my studies have also opened my eyes to the importance of sustainable and environmentally friendly design in architecture. I have learned about the latest technologies and practices architects are using to minimise the impact of buildings on the environment and create more sustainable structures. Overall, this semester has been a truly enriching experience for me, as I have been able to explore my passion for architecture and gain valuable skills and knowledge that will undoubtedly benefit me in my future endeavours.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am extremely satisfied with how this project went and the experiences I gained from it. This project not only enhanced my technical skills, but also my soft skills, which are essential in any career.
                <br>
                I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of this project and contribute towards the betterment of senior citizens lives.
