      <h3>2.2 Client Background & Needs</h3>
      <div class="scroll-object">
        <p>
          The accurate reconstruction of Winchester Castle's architectural elements, such as its towers, curtain walls, and other features, posed a significant challenge for this 3D modelling project. Initial attempts to model the towers, curtain walls, and other elements highlighted a lack of clarity, particularly regarding building heights. To address this, I consulted with my client, utilising additional material from English Heritage and other sources (Figure 3.2.1). A visit to the Great Hall, where a 3D model was displayed, proved valuable in understanding the tower shapes and layout (Figure 3.2.2). However, crucial details like arrow slits and crenellations remain unclear. Further research was necessary, so I contacted Hampshire Cultural Trust for details on the model used in the Great Hall, seeking information about its creator's source materials.
        </p>
        <p>
          The north apex tower, partially excavated, provided the only precise measurement, with its diameter recorded as 12.8 meters <a href="https://ancientmonuments.uk/100240-winchester-castle-winchester-st-michael-ward" target="_blank" class="no-style-link"> (Ancient Monuments UK, n.d.).</a> I estimated the height at 16 meters, based on the fact that it was not taller than the Great Hall, which is 16.8 meters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Castle" target="_blank" class="no-style-link"> (Wikipedia, 2025)</a> (Figure 3.2.3).
        </p>
        <p>
          Records indicated the south motte had a significant 'Great Tower', which was rebuilt in 1259-60 (HKW 860) (Figure 3.2.4). However, the exact size and location of this on the motte are unclear. While other tower dimensions remain uncertain, estimates suggest larger towers may reach 15-20 meters in diameter <a href="http://www.castlestudiesgroup.org.uk/CSG%20Journal%202019-2020rev7-Winchester%20Castle-lowres.pdf" target="_blank" class="no-style-link"> (Castles Studies Group, 2019).</a> Based on my visual scale and the Winchester Castle model found in the Great Hall, I decided to set the height of the largest tower on the south at approximately 21 meters. This decision was made to fit the historical context and provide a strategic advantage in defence and visibility. Additionally, other towers were designed to be higher than the North Apex tower.
        </p>
        <p>
          The curtain walls were two meters thick and included a wall walk (Figure 3.2.5), as depicted in some illustrations and the Winchester Castle model in the Great Hall. The walls reached a height of nine meters, including crenellations, based on general knowledge of medieval defensive wall construction <a href="https://medievalbritain.com/type/medieval-life/architecture/parts-of-a-medieval-castle-the-curtain-wall/" target="_blank" class="no-style-link"> (Medieval Britain, n.d.).</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The design of the gate and portcullis was also a challenge, as no surviving details exist. I relied on historical research about such features in other medieval castles <a href="http://www.castlestudiesgroup.org.uk/CSGJournal2010-11X4Doors.pdf" target="_blank" class="no-style-link"> (Castles Studies Group, 2011)</a> to guide the reconstruction, following heritage records and architectural principles from the medieval period (Figure 3.2.6).
        </p>
        <p>
          Records about Winchester Castle were difficult to find, as many have been lost over time. To fill in the gaps, I adopted elements from Windsor Castle, a castle of similar age and origin, for reference. This included details such as crenellations, arrow slits, narrow windows, and corbels <a href="https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/berks/vol3/pp29-56" target="_blank" class="no-style-link"> (British History Online, 1923</a>;  <a href="https://everycastle.com/windsor-castle/" target="_blank" class="no-style-link">EveryCastle.com, n.d.</a>)(Figure 3.2.7). William the Conqueror initiated both castles, supporting this decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          While examining Winchester Castle's Great Hall, I noted buttresses supporting the wall (Figure 3.2.8). This detail, observed both on the castle model's curtain and in illustrations, will be incorporated into my 3D model for added structural accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          These efforts ensure that the 3D model of Winchester Castle is as historically accurate and detailed as possible, providing a valuable resource for understanding its architectural heritage.

    <h2>3. Research Process</h2>

    <article class="subsection">
      <h3>Historical Sources</h3>
      <p>
        The "Virtual Winchester" project, spearheaded by CEDI, is a pioneering initiative using 3D modelling with Unreal Engine to create an immersive digital experience of Winchester during the Jane Austen and Medieval (1400) periods. My primary role involved the creation of a historically accurate model of Winchester Castle. This process included extensive research, drawing upon online dimensions and historical sources, which was further enhanced by a visit to the Great Hall Museum, providing critical insight into the castle's architectural details. The project ultimately aims to bring the archaeological finds and artefacts to life, guided by historical figures within their accurate settings, offering an engaging and educational cultural heritage experience.

            <h1>7.2 Final Prototype and Visualisations</h1>
            <p>
               This section showcases the final prototype of Winchester Castle through various visualisations. These include perspective reconstructions from the south-west and west, detailed views of the east curtain wall, and specific structures like the Great Gate, North Apex Tower, and Upper Ward towers. The designs blend historical insights with informed architectural choices.
