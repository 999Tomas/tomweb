            <h5>1.1 Introduction to the Project</h5>
            <p>
                The interactive game project "Book & Pen" invites players into an enthralling narrative centred around the investigation of a missing person, intricately weaving elements of mystery and exploration. Designed to immerse participants in a captivating storyline, this project uniquely combines virtual reality with physical interaction, fostering a cohesive and innovative gaming experience. My primary role was to craft 3D assets that would not only enhance the aesthetic appeal, but also contribute meaningfully to the exploration and problem-solving aspects of the game.<br>

                At the heart of "Book & Pen" is a dynamic two-player experience. One player assumes the role of “The Book,” engaging in research and analysis using files and clues outside the VR environment. Meanwhile, the second player, dubbed “The Pen,” interacts directly with the captivating virtual space, using tools and puzzles to uncover vital information. This collaborative framework encourages teamwork and communication, enabling players to piece together clues that lead to the mystery.

            <h5>1.2 Research</h5>
            <p>
                This research stage was crucial for developing 3D assets for our dark academia-inspired interactive experience. I focused on the specific furniture characteristic of this aesthetic, analysing key materials, patterns, textures, and colour palettes. I discovered that dark academia emphasises richly textured woods, particularly walnut and mahogany, often featuring ornate carvings, complemented by a colour palette of dark, muted tones, including forest and olive green.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Subsequently, I focused on the construction of our project assets, identifying the components and their nomenclature. The piano asset proved to be the most complex, with intricate parts and shapes that initially posed challenges. However, this research effectively addressed my queries and facilitated a smoother progression into the next development stages.

            <h5>1.3 References</h5>
            <p>
                In our project asset references, we have carefully selected items that align seamlessly with the interactive room atmosphere we aim to create. Notably, several of these references, particularly the open piano and the Victorian settee (settee number 1), feature intricate high-poly details. The Victorian settee is adorned with elaborate carvings that embody the dark academic aesthetic we envision. However, we must consider the implications of these decorative elements, as they significantly increase the polygon count—an aspect we need to manage judiciously. Given our constraints of 2,500 polygons per mesh, we opted for a more streamlined design for settee number 2, which lacks the ornate carvings. I concluded the final model would resemble settee number 2, omitting the button detailing on the backrest, while also employing pyramidal cabriole legs. To enhance realism, I integrated textures that reflect the fabric and wood materials used in the seating.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As for the open piano, its complexity stems from multiple components, each contributing to a high polygon count. To optimise game performance and adhere to our polygon limitations, we will modify the piano model to a closed configuration, excluding any internal elements. This strategic decision will not only maintain visual coherence, but also promote efficient rendering within the interactive experience.

            <p>
                I selected the settee as my primary asset for 3D modelling due to its intricate design and the challenges it presents. To facilitate a clearer developmental process, I created a detailed sketch, breaking the settee down into distinct components and numbering each section methodically. This structured approach allowed me to address the complexities of the design more effectively. I began by detailing the seat section, followed by the backrest, then the armrests, and finally the legs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In addition to outlining the design, I also specified the materials required for the project. For the legs, I opted for rich hardwood to ensure durability and a classic aesthetic, while the upholstery will feature luxurious velvet to enhance both comfort and visual appeal. This comprehensive plan serves as a foundation for the 3D development of the settee, ensuring a cohesive and well-executed final model.

                I started with a cube form. To get the right model form, I added the standard dimensions for a three seat sofa length 87” depth 31” and seat height 10” The dimensions details I was using from the site dimensions.com.

            <img src="img/seat-done.png" style="">
            <p>
                Then I added a couple loop cuts on the Y & X axis, and X axis loop cut I slightly grabbed downward. My mesh, the bottom part now looks not very rounded. Lastly, I shaded smooth.

                Then I applied the mirror modifier, because my model back side must be not symmetrical. The left side is higher than the right side. Thus, in the next step, I selected the half back top edges of this mesh and extruded upward a few times. Then I extruded one time on the opposite side by selecting edges. Afterwards, I added a couple of loop cuts in Z axis, and I selected top vertices and then downward and some upward by using proportion editing till I got the correct back mesh like my sketch.

<p>Next, I formed the mesh for look nicer, like a curved arm, by adding a few loop cuts, and then grabbed vertices by using proportional editing.<br>
Lastly, I added thickness, shaded smooth and applied mirror modifier.
I applied the mirror modifier, because my model right side must be shorter than the opposite side. Afterwards, on edit mode, I selected the right arm bottom vertices and deleted them. Then, I filled (short cut F) the hole by selecting the bottom part edges. Finally, I selected all mesh (short cut A) and moved downward till it looked symmetrical from the bottom with left side mesh.

                    Texturing is a vital stage in the 3D modelling process, where the surfaces of the object model are equipped with essential properties to enhance realism. For this project, textures were crafted in Blender, using Principled BSDF nodes, a versatile material shader that allows for simulated surface properties.

'A', and finally I pressed a button 'Principled Texture Setup'. It automatically connected all images to principled BSDF. 
This is 3 images, in which one gave a colour of material, another a roughness image controlled the sharpness of the reflections, and a normal map gives small size bumps.

            <p>
                In the creation of the globe sphere part, I employed Adobe Photoshop to develop a textured surface that evokes an aged aesthetic. To achieve this, I began with an old paper texture, which added a sense of history and character to the design. Following this, I superimposed a world map texture and  merged the two layers before applying a colourisation process. The culmination of this workflow involved incorporating the texture into a 3D model in Blender. This was achieved by utilising an image texture node linked to the base colour input of the Principled BSDF shader.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Despite my intention to closely replicate the textures illustrated in my reference images, I faced several challenges throughout the process. The measurement bar texture, in particular, proved difficult to apply accurately, which delayed my progress. Furthermore, while integrating a wooden image texture for the base of the globe, I encountered issues with texture stretching that detracted from the aesthetic. With a tight timeline looming for the game's assets, I decided to simplify my approach, unifying the colours and metallic finishes across various components to maintain visual coherence.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Upon reflection, I realised that the stretching issue I faced with the wooden base was rooted in the UV unwrapping process, which I initially overlooked. After identifying and correcting this flaw, I was able to enhance the appearance of the globe’s stand. The final output includes models showcasing both variations of the stand textures, clearly illustrating the adjustments and refinements made during the development phase. This iterative process not only improved the visual quality of the globe, but also deepened my understanding of texture application in 3D modelling.

                <p>
                   During this project period, I spent significant time enhancing my skills in 3D modelling, resulting in the creation of various models that I am excited to showcase. While these particular models are not meant for use in our group game, they have played a crucial role in my personal artistic development. Fuelled by my desire to produce a compelling video trailer for our game project, I decided to incorporate these models into our game room. This not only added an aesthetic touch, but also allowed me to experiment with different design elements and textures.<br> The process of crafting these models was a rewarding challenge that pushed my creativity and technical abilities. It gave me invaluable insights into 3D design that I can apply to future projects.

                <h1>Animation</h1>
                <p>
                    Animation is a fascinating medium for personal growth, and through this project, I have been able to explore my creative boundaries. My curiosity to bring my created assets to life was a driving force behind my work.<br>
                    One of the most intriguing challenges I faced involved the animation of a puzzle made from the numbered pieces of a smashed window.<br>
                    I meticulously crafted the sequence of the pieces falling into place, illustrating how they needed to sit next to each other to form the final shape. This exercise not only honed my animation skills but also taught me the importance of patience and precision in problem-solving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, I created an animation of a rotating globe. This particular piece required a meticulous approach to ensure that the rotation appeared smooth and realistic.<br>
                    Down below, I explain in detail how I created the animation of the rotating globe.
                </p>

            <h5>Rotating Globe</h5>
            <video src="videos/globe.webm" autoplay muted></video>
            <p>
               I guided my globe reference. I tilted the globe to the left from the front view by 23.4 degrees, like our Earth obliquity. To ensure my globe rotated to this axis, I switched the rotation axis to local. Afterwards, I added an empty object. Then I selected the globe, clicked on the constraint tab, and added a copy rotation constraint and selected the empty object as target. I needed to copy only the target Z location. Thus, I disabled X & Y rotations and switched to local space for the owner. Time to animate. At frame 1 in the timeline, I hit 'I' on the viewport and inserted a rotation key. Then I went to frame 100, and I increased the Z rotation value a bit, and by right clicking I added a key frame. Animation is working, but in the end the rotation is slowing down. By default, it uses bezier interpolation. To get the constant speed on the timeline, I pressed 'T' and changed the key frame interpolation to linear. Next, I needed my globe to rotate non stop, thus I did the cycles animation. I went to Graph editors and pressed the 'N' key, then clicked on the modifier tab, adding a cycles modifier. Then it has another issue, it runs back all the time. I fixed this problem by switching to repeat with the offset option. Animation done.

                <h1>Mastering Video Editing: My Growth Journey</h1>
                <p>
                    This video presentation showcases our team project, highlighting the contributors and the core concept of our interactive game experience.<br> 
I created this video to enhance my video editing skills, experimenting with techniques such as cutting, splicing, adding visual effects, and animating objects. The animation was rendered in PNG format, allowing me to compile the image sequences into a cohesive video. Throughout the editing process, I meticulously trimmed and refined the footage to enhance clarity and flow. After grouping the elements into a meta strip and exporting in FFmpeg format, I achieved the final video output.
</p>
<br>
<p>
This endeavour was a significant milestone in my first-year journey, reflecting my ambition and dedication, despite a few noticeable errors. Challenges such as camera movements, speed inconsistencies, and issues with particle systems not disappearing as intended were present. Unfortunately, I opted not to correct these due to the substantial time required for high-resolution rendering.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Creating this video has provided me with valuable experience and insights into the animation and video editing process. While I encountered several learning opportunities through my mistakes, I am confident that the skills I developed will greatly enhance my capabilities in future projects.
