            <p>
                When creating a website, capturing the user's attention is paramount. Extensive research has led me to analyse various design elements, and I have identified several styles that resonate with me. The elegance of the design, the thoughtful layout, and the compelling content of these examples were particularly impactful. One feature that stood out was the left sidebar navigation, which offers a streamlined and efficient browsing experience. Consequently, I have decided to incorporate a left sidebar menu into my own website to enhance user navigation.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In terms of aesthetics, I am considering a pinkish colour palette complemented by black elements, or alternatively, a dark mode theme accented with a border aesthetic in blue. Both options aim to create a visually appealing and engaging environment that attracts users, while ensuring easy readability and accessibility. Ultimately, my goal is to design a website that not only captivates visitors, but also provides them with a seamless and enjoyable user experience.

            <h5>1.2 Wireframe Sketches</h5>
            <p>
               In the process of designing my wire-frame sketches for both desktop and mobile views, I explored two distinct variations that seek to enhance the user experience on the homepage. The first sketch, showcased on the right-hand side, presents a desktop view of a homepage with small, clickable images that direct users to their respective project pages. The simplicity of this layout allows for efficient navigation, but I also envisioned a portfolio page that utilises eye-catching animations created from some of my models. My intention is to have a dynamic visual that occupies the entire screen and acts as a clickable element leading to the detailed projects page. This interactive feature is designed to engage users and showcase my work effectively.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, as I delved deeper into the functionality of my wire-frames, I realised that having a standalone portfolio page might not be necessary, considering that all projects will already be accessible from the homepage. This insight drove me to conduct further research, leading to the innovative concept of integrating horizontal scrolling into my design. The second variation sketch, displayed on the left-hand side, introduces a homepage with larger images that are more visually appealing. In this iteration, the portfolio section will slide horizontally when the user scrolls, revealing images with tags that link to each project. This approach not only enhances the aesthetic appeal, but also conserves vertical screen space, allowing for a more streamlined navigation experience. Overall, I believe this design could significantly enhance user engagement while effectively showcasing my portfolio.

            <h5>1.3 Digital Wireframes & Layouts</h5>
            <p>
               Expanding my design exploration, I utilised Adobe XD to create several additional wire-frames. Ultimately, I gravitated towards the second hand-sketched wire-frame with a horizontal scrolling portfolio page, as it offers a more cohesive arrangement of website content compared to my previous iterations. I am particularly pleased with this horizontal layout, which allows visitors to view a gallery of project images immediately upon entering the page. On the right side, they will find the latest project presented as a clickable image, inviting them to delve deeper into that specific project.
               <br>
               My primary goal during this framing process was to maintain a clean and uncluttered design, avoiding an overcrowded user experience. Previously, my attempts resulted in overly busy pages filled with content and small images, which detracted from the aesthetic. In this refined wire-frame, I have opted to feature only the logo of my institution, alongside concise text highlighting my skills and experience, ensuring a streamlined and professional presentation.

            <h5>1.4 Mobile App Wireframes</h5>
            <p>
               After experimenting with various navigation options for my website, I've decided to place the navigation bar at the top. I found the top nav bar offers significantly better visibility on mobile devices, aligning with user habits and expectations. My trials with side, bottom, and top navigation revealed that top links naturally command more attention. This placement allows users to quickly access crucial sections of the site without any fumbling, enhancing the user experience.
               <br>
               <br>
               However, it's important to note that mobile users will not have the same view of the projects page as those using a desktop. With a smaller screen size, space becomes a premium, so I strategically designed the homepage to save space while still offering a horizontal portfolio view. This way, guests can seamlessly discover projects as they scroll—an intuitive gesture for mobile users.
               <br>
               <br>
               I’m also striving to enhance the contact page experience with a more engaging animation. While I developed a video wire-frame for the desktop version, I opted not to include it in the mobile design. This decision was made to avoid overwhelming mobile devices, ensuring that users have a clean and swift interaction. Instead, the mobile contact page will feature a straightforward contact form alongside a centred image, providing a streamlined and user-friendly experience.

            <h5>1.5 Mockup</h5>
            <p>
                For this step, I decided to transform my initial grey line wire frames into more visually realistic models by incorporating detailed elements such as colours, buttons, and typography. The transition from basic grey layouts to vibrant, real-world content was essential in bringing my vision to life. Previously, I had embarked on creating a website without a proper mock-up, and the results left me feeling disheartened. I struggled with design choices, sizing inconsistencies, and navigation issues that hindered the user experience. This frustrating process made it clear that a more structured approach was necessary.
                <br>
                <br>
                Determined to improve, I opted to recreate the website using a mock-up as my guiding tool. This decision was instrumental in streamlining the design process. The new design developed rapidly, allowing me to experiment with different elements and make informed decisions. I overhauled the colour palette, selecting shades that conveyed elegance and sophistication. Additionally, I introduced border elements that added visual interest and cohesion to the layout. The transformation was remarkable; my website now looks significantly better, but also aligns more closely with the aesthetic I had envisioned from the outset. The enhanced details foster a more engaging experience, fulfilling my aspiration for an elegant and polished final product.

            <h1>Prototype</h1>
            <p>
                Creating a prototype was a crucial step in ensuring that my website design aligned with my vision, while avoiding past mistakes. By meticulously mapping out the site before jumping into the construction phase, I saved invaluable time and resources. This thoughtful process allowed me to refine the website design, resulting in an aesthetically pleasing and functional end product. For instance, I noticed that the pinkish hue of the social media link to LinkedIn clashed with the colour scheme of my website, so I opted to change it to a more neutral grey. This small, yet significant adjustment made the link blend seamlessly with the rest of the design.
                <br>
                <br>
                Additionally, I took a critical look at the contact page, where I had originally included several square-shaped background decorations. Upon reflection, I realised that these elements created an overcrowded appearance, detracting from the clean and professional look I aimed for. By reducing the number of decorations, I enhanced the page's readability and appeal. Similarly, I revamped the project web development cover image to better represent my work and style. These deliberate modifications, driven by my prototype phase, not only improved the visual appeal of the website, but also ensured a more cohesive user experience.

            <p>
                In reflecting on the development of my previous website versions, it becomes clear that they were fraught with numerous technical issues, particularly responsiveness and design consistency. The layout presented significant challenges, where margins and positions appeared correctly only on local devices due to an overreliance on pixel-based measurements. This lack of adaptability arose from insufficient research and understanding of responsive design principles.
                <br>
                <br>
                The new iteration of my website is a testament to my experiential learning journey. Armed with insights gained from my past mistakes, I recognised the importance of utilising scalable units and modern frameworks like Bootstrap to create a more fluid and responsive design. Unfortunately, I sometimes carried over aspects of my earlier, more complicated coding practices, which may have delayed the project's development.
                <br>
                <br>
                Despite the progress, there are still unresolved issues within the current site. For instance, while I have implemented a horizontal scrolling feature for the project page, I acknowledge it requires refinement. Moreover, I am aware of the persistent flickering issue with the homepage images, which detracts from the user experience. Moving forward, I am committed to addressing these challenges to enhance site functionality and visual appeal. Overall, this project not only reflects my growth as a developer, but also serves as a foundation for continuous improvement and learning in web design.
