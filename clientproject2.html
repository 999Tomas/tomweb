            <h5>1 Gameplay</h5>
            <p>The dungeon's layout unfolds before the player, a stark grid of pathways and obstacles.<br> 
The challenge is not the dungeon itself, but the player's control over two characters, bound by a magical curse.<br> 
One character can only move up and down, the other left and right. This seemingly impossible restriction is the core of the game's design. Each level presents the player with the task of guiding both characters from a starting point to a finish line, a seemingly impossible feat given their limitations. The only way to proceed is through shared responsibility – both characters must hold the cursed book together, moving in unison. The dungeon, however, is not a forgiving host. Awkward obstacles force the player to separate the characters, navigating them individually through tight spaces and treacherous corners, before rejoining them to continue their journey. And the challenges don't stop there.<br>
 Lurking within the dungeon are enemies, some to avoid, others to defeat.<br> 
Adding another layer of complexity, certain puzzles require the player to use portals and remote control drones, manoeuvring objects between rooms to unlock the path forward. 
This is a puzzle game that requires strategic thinking and coordination, forcing the player to utilise the limitations of their characters to overcome the obstacles and reach their destination.<br>
 It's a game where the curse that binds the characters becomes the key to their success.

            <p>
                TORCH & CRUCIBLE<br>
                This project marked a significant step in my artistic journey, as I immersed myself in the intricate world of Aztec art style through 3D modelling with the Feature Finishing - Artwork team. Our mission was to craft assets for the game with the Aztec aesthetics.<br>
                I took on the challenge to create three distinct assets – an Aztec torch, a crucible, and a barrel dispenser.
            </p>
            <p>
                The style presented a unique hurdle, demanding meticulous attention to detail and significant time investment. The journey was not without its obstacles, with numerous errors cropping up along the way. However, these setbacks proved invaluable learning experiences, particularly in the realm of sculpting. This project served as a focal point for my personal goal of enhancing my sculpting skills and achieving greater freedom in wielding the sculpting tools.
            </p>
             <p>BARREL DISPENSER<br>
                My goal was to incorporate intricate Aztec elements, while ensuring the new design seamlessly fits the original dimensions and location of the existing model.<br>
                Also, the art direction had to seamlessly blend with pre-existing assets, creating a cohesive visual experience.<br>
                Limitation, narrowed my design options.<br>
                One of the most challenging aspects of this asset was optimising the design within the same footprint. This meant I had to find a way to transform an ordinary dispenser into a stylised game asset, without increasing its size or changing its functionality. This required a lot of creativity and problem-solving, as I had to find ways to add visual interest and detail to the dispenser without making it any larger.
            </p>
            <p>
                To overcome this challenge, I found it helpful to communicate regularly with the art director and generate AI concept ideas. By working closely with the art director, I was able to better understand their vision for the project and incorporate their feedback into my designs. Additionally, by generating AI concept ideas, I was able to explore various design possibilities and ultimately find a solution that met the project's requirements while also being visually appealing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here I will chronicle the process of model creation, offering a glimpse into the evolution of my sculpting and texturing abilities as I navigated the complexities of this artistic endeavour. It will showcase the growth I experienced, highlight the challenges overcome and the valuable lessons learned, ultimately demonstrating the transformative power of perseverance and dedication in artistic pursuit.

            <p>
                TORCH<br>
                I encountered significant issues and errors during the sculpting stage of my models, which led me to reevaluate my approach and create a plan to move forward. One of the models that gave me trouble was the torch, particularly the concept's pattern, which was unclear and needed further development. To address this, I decided to generate additional concepts to find more defined Aztec symbols that would work well for the torch model.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once I had a set of symbols that I felt confident in, I began sketching the torch model using blocks. This allowed me to break down the torch into more manageable sections and plan out the sculpting process more effectively. I made a plan for each block of the torch, determining which symbol would be sculpted and where it would be placed. This approach helped me visualise the final product better and ensured that the symbols were well-integrated into the torch design.
            </p>
            <p>
                BARREL DISPENCER<br>
                During the initial stages of designing the barrel dispenser, I faced numerous challenges that significantly delayed progress and resulted in the waste of valuable time. To overcome these obstacles and increase efficiency, I decided to adopt a systematic approach to the design process.
            </p>
            <p>
                First and foremost, I began by sketching the primary Aztec symbols intended for inclusion in the design of the doorway, gear section, and activation panel. This step was crucial in ensuring that the dispenser seamlessly blends into the dungeon environment and aligns with the existing art direction.<br>Once the Aztec art elements were identified and sketched, I was back to Blender. I added generating AI concepts on the work screen. I then utilised annotated tools to carefully annotate the concept and pull out specific ideas and elements that I wanted to use in the model. This process allowed me to create a detailed representation of the barrel dispenser, complete with all the necessary Aztec art elements.

            <p>
                The modelling phase progressed seamlessly for all three assets, encountering no significant conceptual complexities. The barrel dispenser initially presented a brief challenge in terms of ideation. However, once the concept was finalised, its implementation was swift and straightforward. The torch, however, required some revisions to align with the intended design. The ring-shaped components were initially misshapen, and other parts exhibited scale size discrepancies. These issues were promptly addressed based on feedback from the art director, resulting in a model that fully met the desired specifications.

            <p>
                The sculpting stage consumed countless hours, fulfilling one of my academic goals for the year. Contrary to last year's tedious sculpting experience with a lizard cloak, this semester's creation of a barrel dispenser model proved an unexpectedly enjoyable process. I believe my mistakes while sculpting the torch model strengthened my understanding of sculpting tools, enabling me to approach the dispenser with greater speed and confidence. As I immersed myself in the sculpting process, I began to grasp the techniques and create elements without relying on online tutorials.<br> Comparing the barrel dispenser to the torch, the former possessed a larger scale and required more meticulous detailing.<br>
                I complete the sculpted part significantly faster than the torch model. Crucially, the successful outcome stemmed from a clear plan and vision for the elements to be incorporated. I completed the design in approximately 8 hours, a personal record in sculpting. I am immensely satisfied with the final result, which reflects my improved skills and understanding of the craft.

          <h5>1.5 Sculpting Techniques</h5>
          <p>Stencil <br>
            During the sculpting stage, several issues arose, particularly with the torch and crucible models. Blurred pattern areas were evident, especially in the initial torch model created using a stencil. The use of a stencil was discontinued due to unsatisfactory aesthetic results, and I was exploring alternative techniques.
            The underlying cause of the stencil method's failure requires further investigation, which will be pursued in my spare time to prevent similar issues in future projects.
        </p>
        <p>VDM baker <br>
            The sculpting stage in the creation of Aztec patterns involved a distinctive workflow that utilised the VDM brush baker. Initially, a mesh plane was introduced into the scene, acting as a canvas for the desired element. This element was then meticulously sculpted, and the result was baked. The baked brush was subsequently saved and made available within the brush library, allowing the swift application of the created element to models with a simple click.<br>

            While this method offered speed and efficiency, the edges of the newly formed symbols often exhibited a degree of sharpness. Attempts to alleviate these imperfections using the smooth brush proved unsuccessful. Despite this setback, the VDM brush baking technique provided a powerful tool for the rapid incorporation of any element into models. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I was unable to determine the cause of the sharp edges in my elements. However, I intend to explore this issue further in my free time.
        </p>
        <p>Mask<br>
            The most effective method for achieving clear elements involved masks. Desired mesh faces were edited by drawing a symbol, which was then inverted using the shortcut (Ctrl-I). The mesh filter was used to deform the desired faces by dragging them away from the mesh and creating a negative effect by clicking and dragging into the mesh.<br>
            Mirror symmetry was applied along the appropriate axis, depending on the face areas. Radial symmetry was also used, repeating the stroke 360 degrees around the central axis for a specified number of times.<br>Although this masking method was more time-consuming than using VDM brushes or stencils, it produced superior results that were more closely aligned with the existing art direction.

            <h5>1.6 Invisible Faces: A Texturing Obstacle Course</h5>
            <p>
                Embarking on the journey of texturing my 3D models using Substance Painter, I encountered an initial hurdle. Importing my torch and barrel dispenser models, I faced a problem – some model faces were invisible.<br>
                After some troubleshooting, I realised the problem stemmed from my Blender workflow. Switching to solid mode and clicking on 'Face Orientation', I discovered the culprit – red faces that were pointing outwards, when they should have been facing inwards. This meant Substance Painter could not properly render these faces, resulting in their invisibility. <br>The solution was simple. Back in edit mode, I selected all the model faces and flipped their orientation using the handy shortcut, Alt + N. This quick fix resolved the invisible face issue, allowing me to continue my texturing journey in Substance Painter

       <h5>1.7 Texturing</h5>
       <p>
        I utilised Substance Painter software for this stage, and the torch, the first model I tackled, presented challenges. This phase therefore provides valuable insight into the initial hurdles encountered and the lessons learned during the texturing process.
       </p>
        <p>
        My initial attempt to create a stylised stone texture for the torch model fell short of expectations. The base colour lacked depth and variation, missing the subtle shifts. Ambient occlusion was absent, leaving the texture flat and devoid of the natural shadows that define form. Edges lacked the necessary highlights, further contributing to a lack of visual interest. Recognising these shortcomings, I returned to tutorials, carefully studying the techniques employed by experienced artists. This newfound knowledge allowed me to create a significantly improved texture. The base colour now exhibited a much richer palette, showcasing nuanced variations that added depth and visual appeal. I also incorporated ambient occlusion, bringing a sense of natural shadowing and enhancing the texture's dimensionality. Furthermore, I added subtle edge highlights, creating a sense of sharpness and definition.
    </p>
    <p>
    In my quest for artistic perfection, I sought the guidance of the art director, whose insights proved invaluable. He astutely observed that desaturating the colours throughout the model would enhance its visual appeal. Furthermore, he suggested swapping the base colour of the torch's drown part with the barrel dispenser, a seemingly minor adjustment that, in retrospect, had a profound impact.
</p>
<p>
    These final adjustments significantly enhanced the look and feel of the torch, making it more integrated within the game's environment. The results were incredibly satisfying, breathing life into the asset and contributing to a more engaging visual experience.<br>
The entire process was a valuable learning experience, highlighting the importance of continuous improvement, seeking feedback, and the collaborative nature of game development.

            This project became a testament to the growth I experienced throughout the academic year, showcasing my evolution in both sculpting and texturing. The journey from initial concept to finalised models is a testament to the power of perseverance and joy of pushing creative boundaries – a journey that will undoubtedly shape my artistic journey for years to come.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience for me, as it taught me how to work within constraints and find creative solutions to complex design challenges. Despite the limitations and challenges I faced, I am proud of the final result and feel that I was able to create a visually cohesive and engaging game asset.
