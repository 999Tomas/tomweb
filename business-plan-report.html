            <p>
              This project focuses on developing the foundations of my freelance 3D visualisation practice, Tomas Dulkys Visuals. The aim was to understand my place in the industry, define my services, and create a clearer structure for how I work with clients. A key part of this process was improving how I communicate my workflow and present my work in a simple, transparent, and professional way.
            </p>

            <p>
              Throughout the project, I explored industry research, brand development, my unique selling proposition, and a full case study based on a reception transformation. I also identified my target audience, planned straightforward marketing approaches, and considered sustainable professional practice through SDG 8. The project concludes with financial planning and a reflection on my goals moving forward.
            </p>

            <p>
              Overall, this overview sets the direction for the full report and shows how each section contributes to building a more confident, structured, and sustainable freelance practice.

              <h3>Industry Context and Visual Trends</h3>
              <div class="scroll-object">
               <p class="section-brief">
                My research began by reviewing current architectural visualisation practices to understand how the industry communicates design ideas. Architectural visualisation continues to be dominated by still imagery, largely because it is efficient, cost‑effective, and deeply embedded in design workflows <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lMzuVazM-1oC&q=virtual+environment&source=gbs_word_cloud_r&cad=2#v=snippet&q=virtual%20environment&f=false" target="_blank" class="no-style-link">(Whyte, 2002)</a>.  Still renders remain the primary deliverable used by architects, interior designers, and developers when communicating proposals to clients and planning authorities.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the same time, industry reports show a growing interest in motion‑supported and immersive tools, particularly within larger studios that have the resources to adopt new technologies. Survey data from Chaos Group highlights this shift by asking professionals which technologies they believe will become more prevalent in architectural workflows <a href="https://blog.chaos.com/future-of-architectural-visualization-survey-results"target="_blank" class="no-style-link">(Prelikj, 2025)</a>.
              </p>

              <p>
                 Figure 1 shows that real‑time rendering (20%), AI‑assisted visualisation (18%), photorealistic stills (17%), and architectural animations (16%) are all expected to grow. Importantly, photorealistic still imagery remains one of the top expected growth areas, almost equal to animation and VR. This confirms that static visualisation continues to play a central role, even as new tools emerge.
              </p>

              <p>
                Academic research also supports the communicative value of dynamic media. Portman et al. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019897151500054X"target="_blank" class="no-style-link">(2015)</a> argue that staged or sequential visuals can improve spatial understanding by revealing depth, atmosphere, and change over time — particularly for non‑design audiences. This suggests that the value of motion lies in clarity and progression, not spectacle.
              </p>

              <p>
                Analysis of contemporary studios such as Ninety90, The Boundary, and House of Blue Beans reinforces this. These studios produce complex animations, but their effectiveness comes from controlled visual communication: gradual spatial reveal, careful framing, lighting progression, and selective focus. Their workflows rely on large teams, extended timelines, and substantial budgets, making them unsuitable for a solo early‑career freelancer. 
              </p>

              <p>
                This research shaped a key distinction in my project. While motion‑based visualisation offers clear communicative benefits, its production demands make it impractical as a core freelance service. Instead, I extracted transferable principles — sequencing, clarity, and staged revelation — which can be applied within still imagery and small‑scale visual development.

              <h3>Personal Reflection & Direction</h3>
              <div class="scroll-object">
                <p>
                  My interest in motion‑supported visualisation began a few years ago during a real client project, which I later repurposed for a university social‑media module. As part of that module, I created a short reel showing the interior space transitioning from a simple viewport render into a fully textured, lit interior environment. This experiment was originally intended for self‑promotion, but it revealed something important: viewers engaged more strongly with the unfolding sequence than with the static images alone. This experience made me aware of how movement, progression, and atmosphere can support spatial understanding.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Because of this earlier success, I entered this module with a strong interest in animation and initially positioned motion storytelling at the centre of my business idea. Influences such as Your Home Made Perfect reinforced this direction, with its step‑by‑step design reveal format. However, after presenting my business pitch and receiving feedback, I recognised a gap between my creative ambition and the practical realities of freelance work.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Producing animation as a core service requires significant time, technical complexity, rendering resources, and revision management — all of which directly affect pricing, turnaround, and sustainability. As a solo practitioner, this approach would not be viable.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Although full animation is not viable as a core freelance service, motion remains part of my practice in a more focused form. I continue to create short 6–10 second clips — such as light transitions, simple camera moves, or atmosphere changes — when they add clarity or value for clients. These small motion elements are efficient to produce, suitable for social media and property marketing, and allow me to use my interest in movement without relying on large‑scale animation workflows.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This realisation marked a turning point. My core offering remains still visualisation, strengthened by staged development visuals that reflect how designs evolve. This shift aligns my creative interests with a realistic, sustainable freelance model.

              <div class="scroll-object">
                <p class="section-brief">
                  At the beginning of this module, when I was still exploring animation as a potential core service, I created a low‑poly storyboard sequence for my business pitch presentation. The aim was to test motion‑based visual storytelling by showing a hotel reception renovation unfolding through staged transformation, using simple geometry to emphasise movement, atmosphere, and design evolution.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This storyboard now serves as an early research artefact. It captures the direction I explored before recognising that full animation is not sustainable for a solo freelance practice. More importantly, the experiment helped identify which motion principles — such as sequencing and staged reveal — could be adapted into my still‑image workflow.

    <h3>Logo Evolution</h3>
    <div class="scroll-object">
    <p>
      The logo development process shows how my thinking has changed over time. Earlier versions were mainly about experimenting with shapes and tools, while later versions focused more on simplicity, usability, and how the logo works in real digital contexts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Slide 1 shows the progression of the logo from 2021 to 2025. The 2021 and 2023 logos represent an exploratory phase where the focus was mainly on visual experimentation and learning software tools rather than creating a practical brand asset. The 2021 Illustrator logo uses repeated square forms to explore simple geometric construction, while the 2023 Blender work develops this into three‑dimensional cube‑based structures with varied faces and materials. At this stage, the aim was to create something visually interesting, not necessarily something that would work as a consistent, everyday logo.
    </p>

    <p>
      The 2025 stage marks a shift toward a more business‑ and client‑focused way of thinking. Although the 3D “TD” logo already existed before this module, the Enterprise and entrepreneurship content encouraged me to look at it from a branding and usability perspective rather than just as a visual object. When I tested the logo on my website, I found that the white 3D version often lost contrast or clashed with imagery, especially at smaller sizes. This highlighted a key lesson from branding research: a logo needs to be clear, adaptable, and legible in different sizes and formats, and it should work in simple black‑and‑white as a starting point (Wheeler, 2017; Airey, 2014).
    </p>

     <p>
      In response, I simplified the logo into a flat system with both black and white versions. The final mark still combines the initials “TD” into a single connected form: the vertical stroke of the “T” replaces the left side of the “D”, and the upper edge of the “D” overlaps to complete the structure. By flattening the design and focusing on structure rather than 3D effects, the logo became easier to read, more flexible across digital platforms, and better suited to sit alongside my visualisation work without competing with it. This change reflects a broader shift in my understanding of design: away from purely aesthetic experimentation and toward practical, brand‑aware decision‑making that supports long‑term use in a freelance business context.
    </p>

    <p>
      Slide 2 shows sketches from 2021 to 2025. These helped me test different ideas, compare options, and gradually reduce the design to a clearer final direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Slide 3 includes AI‑generated visuals used early in the process. These helped me explore alternative shapes, depth, and structure, giving me more ideas before moving into sketching and refinement. This stage supported the development of a more resolved and confident final logo.

    <h3>Colour Palette & Typography</h3>
    <div class="scroll-object">
      <p>
        The colour palette and typography were chosen intentionally from a client’s point of view. I am naturally drawn to darker tones because they feel calm, focused, and easier on the eyes, especially when viewing visual content for longer periods. Research in visual perception and interface design suggests that darker backgrounds can reduce visual noise and help foreground content stand out more clearly, particularly in image-led layouts (Hall & Hanna, 2004; Lidwell et al., 2010).
      </p>

      <p>
        From a client perspective, dark backgrounds support a more immersive experience by directing attention toward imagery rather than interface elements (Nielsen Norman Group, 2020). This approach is widely used by contemporary visual studios such as Ninety90, whose work initially caught my attention and prompted me to reflect more critically on how colour influences perception and emotional response. Through this module, I moved beyond personal preference and began analysing why certain visual strategies feel effective, translating those insights into my own brand design.
      </p>

      <p>
         Playfair Display was chosen for headings and calls to action because its elegant, editorial character feels refined and timeless, which strongly resonates with me and suits the darker colour palette. It gives the brand a sense of class and intention. Roboto was retained for body text as it had already worked well within my existing website and continues to offer clear, modern readability. Together, the two typefaces balance personality and clarity — allowing the brand to feel expressive without distracting from the visual work.

                  This website redevelopment builds on an existing academic portfolio. Although functional, it lacked a clearly defined client journey, with some scrolling behaviour, navigation labels, and layout decisions shaped more by intuition than by structured design planning.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As I began positioning myself as a freelance 3D visualiser, feedback and discussion during the module played a key role in shifting my focus. A lecture by Andy Blair, Head of Marketing at the University of Winchester, alongside conversations with my tutor, highlighted the importance of brand clarity, user experience, and intentional layout decisions. This prompted me to reassess how my website communicates value to first-time visitors, not just how it presents work.
                </p>

                <p>
                  From a client’s perspective, I recognised the need to simplify communication. Navigation labels such as <em>Immersive Experiences</em> and <em>Unleash Your Vision</em> were visually expressive but not immediately clear. These were revised to more direct terms such as <em>Projects</em> and <em>Contact</em>, reducing cognitive effort and helping users quickly understand what the site contains and where to go next.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I chose to develop the existing platform into my professional brand instead of creating a new website under a different name. Retaining the same website and identity allowed continuity while enabling a more structured, intentional redesign. New wireframes, mock‑ups, and prototypes were created to rethink layout, spacing, and content flow before further development.
                </p>

                <p>
                  A key focus was developing new <em>Projects</em> and <em>Project Page</em>  layouts for my freelance brand. Inspired by clean studio references such as Ninety90, these designs introduce a simple grid-based Projects page and a narrative-style Project Page to present work clearly. For this report, I am demonstrating the new narrative Project Page using an academic project, showing how the layout, structure, and visual flow will function within my professional brand.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Through my research and competitor analysis, I realised that many visualisation studios focus almost entirely on final images, often without showing the thinking or progression behind the work. From my perspective, this creates a polished but incomplete experience for new visitors. This insight shaped my decision to structure the new narrative Project Page around a few clear stages, reflecting my process‑led approach and giving users a simple, transparent view of how a project develops. It supports a more honest and engaging brand experience, helping visitors quickly understand how I work and what they can expect from my approach.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The redesign also introduced clearer calls-to-action across the site. Previously, pages often ended without encouraging further interaction. New CTAs such as <em>Get in touch</em> and <em>More projects</em> were added to key points on the Welcome, About, Projects, and Project pages to guide users toward contact or continued exploration, supporting both usability and business goals.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Overall, this process reflects a shift from an academic portfolio toward a client-focused digital presence, using wireframes, mock-ups, and prototyping not to replace an existing site, but to refine it into a clear, professional freelance platform.

                    Low-fidelity wireframes were created to slow down the design process and think more carefully about structure and user flow. At this stage, my focus was not on visual style, but on how content is organised, how sections relate to each other, and how a visitor moves through the site.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Creating wireframes helped me step away from designing directly in code and instead plan decisions deliberately. This was especially important when shaping the Projects and Project Page layouts, where clarity, pacing, and hierarchy needed to support both quick browsing and deeper engagement.

          <div class="section-brief">
            <p>
              My freelance practice is defined by a process‑led approach to architectural visualisation, where clarity and client understanding are prioritised over isolated final imagery. Instead of jumping directly to a polished render, I guide clients through a structured sequence of visual stages that explain how the design develops—from initial spatial layout to final atmosphere and materiality. This approach ensures that clients understand the reasoning behind each decision before construction or detailed design begins.
            </p>

            <p>
              Through my research and project experience, I found that still imagery remains the dominant output in architectural visualisation, yet many clients struggle to interpret a single final render without context. My observations also showed that sequencing, visual explanation, and staged development help non‑design clients understand spatial decisions more confidently. My workflow responds directly to these insights by breaking the visualisation process into clear, comprehensible steps.
            </p>

            <p>
              My standard workflow includes low‑poly blockouts of the existing and proposed layouts, supported by annotated viewport renders that highlight spatial changes. Once the layout is approved, I develop clay renders with accurate furniture and lighting positions, followed by a material and atmosphere moodboard that establishes the intended palette and design direction. This staged process is illustrated in the workflow visual, which outlines the four key steps used in client projects.
            </p>

             <p>
              Although animation formed part of my research, my practice applies these insights in a more practical and sustainable way. Instead of producing full motion sequences, I use motion‑informed principles—such as sequencing, controlled reveal, and focused attention—within still imagery and staged development. When appropriate, I also produce short 6–10 second clips using the same scene setup, offering an efficient add‑on for social media or marketing without the cost or complexity of full animation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Positioning my practice in this way distinguishes it from static‑only freelancers and high‑budget animation studios. It allows me to offer a clear, communicative, and client‑friendly visualisation experience while maintaining a realistic, sustainable workflow suited to independent freelance practice.

              <h3>Project Context & Brief</h3>
              <p>
                This case study is based on a real hotel renovation project completed during my client placement module. The wider renovation included exterior cladding updates and several internal improvements, but for this report I focus specifically on the reception and entrance sequence — the area that shapes first impressions and sets the tone for the guest experience.
              </p>

              <p>
                The client approached me because they struggled to visualise how the space could look after renovation. Their main goals were to create a brighter, more welcoming reception area suited to long winter seasons, and to explore two key ideas: updating the reception desk and introducing a natural moss feature wall. Moss production is a local industry in this region, where harvested moss is processed and prepared for decorative use. The client was interested in reflecting this local connection within the interior in a subtle, natural way.
              </p>

               <p>
                My role was to translate these ideas into clear visual proposals so the client could understand layout changes, atmosphere, and the overall spatial transformation before construction. Visualisation acted as a communication tool to test options, support decision‑making, and present the design intent in a simple and accessible way.

              <h3>Concept Visualisation — Spatial Transformation</h3>
              <p>
                The concept stage focused on improving how the reception is understood when guests enter. I created simple block‑model layouts showing the current arrangement next to a proposed configuration. This made it easy to compare what guests see first, how they move through the space, and how the main elements relate to each other.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the existing layout, the arrival wall — the first thing guests face — had several elements competing for attention, which weakened the welcome moment. The long reception counter also created an internal corner that staff did not use, making part of the layout unnecessary.
              </p>

              <p>
                The proposed concept simplifies these relationships by clearing the arrival wall and preparing it to function as a single, strong focal point, while also setting it up for the client’s moss feature. A simple circular block is then used to indicate the position of the graphic element planned for this area.
              </p>

              <p>
                Showing both layouts side by side helped communicate these main spatial changes before moving into more detailed development.

              <p>
                To support early spatial understanding, I produced a short viewport clip from the guest’s perspective at the entrance. The first frame shows the seating area and the main focal wall exactly as guests see them when entering. As the camera moves slowly to the right, the proposed half‑circular reception desk block becomes visible, clarifying how the new layout organises the arrival sequence and improves circulation. Presenting this information through a viewport clip strengthened the client’s understanding of the proposed spatial experience at the concept stage.

              <p>
                With the proposed layout approved by the client, the next step was to develop it into early clay‑stage form. These visuals translate the agreed spatial arrangement into clearer shapes, using real furniture proportions and accessory placement to show how the reception desk, seating, and arrival wall begin to take form. Working in clay keeps the focus on scale, flow, and overall organisation before moving into materials and detailed design.

              <p>
               To guide the transition from clay development to final visuals, I prepared a simple material and atmosphere moodboard. The palette focuses on warm natural tones, soft greens, and light timber textures that reflect the surrounding Norwegian landscape and the client’s interest in incorporating locally sourced materials. This stage established the overall atmosphere and colour direction before applying full materials in the final renders, ensuring the design remained aligned with the client’s vision for a brighter and more welcoming reception.

                The final stage focused on atmosphere, materiality, and the guest journey through the space. The five selected visuals were developed to follow the sequence of a real arrival experience, beginning with the exterior entrance and continuing through the secondary doorway into the main reception view, before highlighting the seating area feature wall and the redesigned reception desk. This structured visual approach was not random, as it was based on the client’s request to better understand how guests perceive the space from the moment they enter, and it supports clear decision‑making by showing how the approved layout translates into a coherent, welcoming environment. By improving clarity, flow, and service visibility, these visuals also align with SDG8 by contributing to a more efficient, guest‑focused reception that supports sustainable business growth.

          <div class="section-brief">
            <p>
              My freelance practice supports clients who need to understand and communicate unbuilt spaces clearly before construction. The service is designed for situations where design, approval, or investment decisions rely on visual material, and where drawings or isolated final renders may not provide sufficient clarity.
            </p>

            <p>
              The primary audience includes architectural and interior design studios, property developers, marketing agencies working on property‑led projects, and private residential clients. Across these groups, a shared challenge is the need to explain spatial intent, layout, atmosphere, and design progression in a clear and accessible way.
            </p>

            <p>
              The personas shown above demonstrate how this process‑led visualisation approach responds to different client contexts. Architectural and interior designers use staged visuals to support communication with non‑design clients at early design stages. Property developers require clear still imagery, supported where appropriate by short visual clips, to present unbuilt developments confidently for investment or marketing. Private residential clients benefit from step‑by‑step visual explanation that reduces uncertainty and supports informed decision‑making before construction begins.
            </p>

            <p>
              Across all contexts, the value of the service lies in clarity, structure, and communication rather than animation or spectacle. This aligns with the needs of the target audience while remaining realistic and sustainable for independent freelance practice.

                  My marketing approach begins with ensuring that my work is presented clearly and consistently through my website, which acts as the central point of communication for my freelance practice. During this module, I reviewed the site from a client’s perspective, focusing on how first-time visitors would understand my services, navigate projects, and decide what to do next. This led to practical refinements such as clearer calls-to-action and more structured project presentation. Research in digital marketing highlights that clarity, consistency, and ease of understanding are essential for building trust and encouraging engagement with a brand online (Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick, 2019).
                </p>

                <p>
                  Beyond the website, I recognise that visibility depends on active promotion across platforms where visual and creative services are typically discovered. I plan to share project work on Instagram through short motion clips and atmospheric visuals, use LinkedIn to communicate process-focused and professional content aimed at studios and agencies, and maintain portfolio platforms such as Behance. I also intend to explore freelance marketplaces such as Upwork and Fiverr as a way to gain early client exposure, feedback, and industry experience while establishing my practice.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To support longer-term discoverability, I focus on clear project titles, concise descriptions, and well-structured content. Search engines and AI-supported discovery tools increasingly rely on structured information to understand and surface creative work. Presenting projects in a readable and organised way supports both user understanding and online visibility, which is recognised as a key part of sustainable digital marketing practice (Google Search Central, n.d.).
                </p>

                <p>
                  Together, these decisions reflect a considered approach to promoting my work as a freelance 3D visualiser. The focus remains on clarity, consistency, and visibility across platforms, supporting steady and realistic growth.

           <p>
            This project links to Sustainable Development Goal 8 by focusing on fair freelance work and steady professional growth. Building my own practice helps me develop my skills, set honest pricing, and work in a responsible way without relying on unpaid or speculative jobs.
          </p>

           <p>
            My visualisation approach also supports more sustainable design choices. By showing staged stills and clear steps, clients can understand space, light, and layout before anything is built. This reduces confusion, avoids unnecessary changes, and helps save time and materials during a project.
          </p>

           <p>
            Overall, the project shows how a small freelance practice can contribute to decent work and sustainable economic growth through clear communication, responsible working methods, and thoughtful design support.

                <p>
                  Tomas Dulkys Visuals operates as a freelance 3D visualisation service offering still renders and occasional short clips for architectural designers, property developers, marketing agencies and private clients. Income is earned on a per-project basis, with pricing shaped by scope and complexity. Freelance practice allows for autonomy, flexible workload, and direct client contact. As a self-employed sole trader, I’m responsible for securing work, delivering services, and managing finances independently. Self-employment is recognised as a form of trade where income is earned through regular commercial activity (HMRC, n.d.).

            <div class="sub-text">
              <h3>Income & Pricing Assumptions</h3>
              <p>
                Pricing is structured around clear project deliverables so that clients understand costs from the outset. Following a review of industry guidance and freelance pricing standards, project-based pricing was selected as a practical and widely used approach for independent visualisation practitioners (A-Wise, 2025). Services focus primarily on architectural still renders, supported where appropriate by short visual clips and selected exports for social or promotional use. This structure reflects the way visualisation is delivered within my practice and supports clear scoping and agreement before production begins.
               </p>

               <p>
                In Year 1, rates are set conservatively to reflect my early-career position, while allowing scope for growth as portfolio quality, experience, and client trust develop. This pricing approach aligns directly with the process-led workflow developed in this project, where staged visual outputs — from layout blockouts through to refined still imagery — help define scope early and manage revisions effectively. By maintaining still imagery as the core service, production time remains predictable, supporting realistic delivery schedules and sustainable income management for a solo freelance practice.
              </p>

              <p>
                These assumptions are reflected in the Year 1 financial forecast, which models a realistic monthly project volume for still renders and occasional short clips, as shown in the Profit & Loss Forecast.

                <h3>Costs & Resources</h3>
                <p>
                  Operating costs are kept minimal to support financial sustainability. Key expenses include software licences (e.g., Adobe Creative Cloud), website hosting, stock assets (HDRIs, textures, music), hardware depreciation, marketing, accounting, and a modest allowance for home-office energy and internet. Freelancers working from home incur business-related utility costs (GOV.UK). As a sole trader, I have no staffing costs, which helps reduce financial risk while maintaining professional standards.

                <p>
                  I prepared a forecast to estimate income and costs for Year 1 using conservative assumptions. Freelance income can be irregular, so I focused on cash flow planning and budgeting to manage changes in workload and payment timing (LT Accounting, 2025). Income is split between core still render projects and optional short clips at a higher rate. Costs cover essential software, hardware, marketing, professional services, and home-office expenses. The forecast shows that consistent project flow and cost control are key to maintaining a positive net income in the first year.

                <h3>Risk & Mitigation</h3>
                <p>
                  As with any freelance practice, there are risks associated with income stability, workload consistency, and time management. In the early stages of the business, project flow may be irregular, and reliance on a small number of clients can create financial uncertainty. There is also a risk that projects expand beyond their original scope if expectations are not clearly defined at the outset.
                </p>

                <p>
                  These risks are mitigated through the structured, process-led workflow developed in this project. By breaking visualisation into clearly defined stages, scope and deliverables can be agreed early, reducing revision creep and helping manage time more effectively. Project-based pricing, combined with clear communication through staged visuals, supports predictable income and clearer client expectations. In addition, keeping operating costs low and focusing on still imagery as the core service reduces financial pressure, supporting sustainability and gradual growth as the freelance practice develops.

          <h2>Reflection & Future Goals</h2>
          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <div class="section-brief">
            <p>
              This project marked a shift in how I approach both design and freelance practice. Working within a business-focused framework required me to step back from purely visual outcomes and consider design from a professional, client-centred perspective. I developed a clearer understanding that effective visualisation is defined not by visual impact alone, but by how practical, clear, and helpful it is for decision-making.
            </p>

            <p>
              One of the most significant changes in my thinking was learning to prioritise purpose over visual complexity. Previously, I often focused on producing highly refined imagery, sometimes beyond what was necessary for the client. Through this project, I recognised that overworking visuals can increase time, cost, and revision cycles without adding real value. Developing a structured, staged workflow helped me focus on delivering the right level of detail at each stage, rather than aiming for maximum visual resolution from the outset.
            </p>

            <p>
              This shift was informed by reflection on earlier client work, where producing final renders too early led to extensive revisions due to misaligned expectations. Applying a process-led approach in the case study—progressing from blockouts to clay renders and then to final visuals—allowed feedback to be addressed earlier and more efficiently. Minor adjustments identified at the clay stage were straightforward to resolve, reducing pressure at the final stage and improving overall delivery. This workflow became the foundation of my unique selling proposition and was tested through the reception case study included in this report.
            </p>

            <p>
              Working alongside a real placement client project highlighted practical constraints that influenced my decisions. The hotel renovation was a large, live project, and the absence of complete CAD drawings required additional time to verify proportions and spatial accuracy remotely. To manage workload realistically and avoid creating a separate or artificial case study for the business module, I selected the reception area as a focused example from an existing professional project. This ensured that the business report remained grounded in real freelance practice while aligning clearly with my service model and staged workflow.
            </p>

            <p>
              Overall, this project strengthened my ability to work in a more structured, disciplined, and professional way. It clarified my approach to workflow, communication, branding, and service definition, and established a realistic foundation for sustainable freelance development.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Future Goals</h3>
          <div class="section-brief">
            <p>
              In the short term, my focus is on completing and publishing the refined project pages on my website, strengthening my portfolio with clear examples of process-led visualisation. I plan to create a small number of short visual clips derived from existing projects and use them selectively for online promotion through platforms such as Instagram and LinkedIn.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the longer term, I aim to work more closely with architectural and interior design studios and property developers, building a reputation based on clarity, reliability, and quality rather than scale. As experience grows, I intend to continue developing my technical skills and software knowledge, with the long-term goal of expanding into a more established practice and, eventually, working collaboratively within a small team.

              The reception transformation case study demonstrated how staged visual development—from early spatial blockouts to clay modelling and final imagery—supports client understanding and improves decision‑making before construction. Alongside this, the brand and website work strengthened professional communication by presenting projects clearly and consistently.
            </p>

            <p>
              Overall, the business model is practical and sustainable, with still imagery as the core service and short clips used selectively when they add value. This approach provides a solid basis for early freelance growth, with future development centred on expanding the portfolio, refining technical skills, and building long‑term client relationships.

          <h2>How I Use AI</h2>
          <h3>AI Use and Language Support</h3>
          <div class="section-brief">
            <p>
              AI Use and Language Support As English is not my first language, I used generative AI tools to support clarity, grammar, and academic tone in my written work. AI was used to refine sentence structure, improve vocabulary, and help organise early drafts of notes. All ideas, arguments, and conceptual development are my own.
            </p>

            <p>
              I critically reviewed all AI-assisted text and did not accept outputs without verification. Where meaning was unclear or inaccurate, I cross-checked information using academic sources, independent research, and peer feedback. All final written content was rewritten and refined by me to reflect my own voice and understanding.

            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>AI Use in Visual Development</h3>
          <div class="section-brief">
            <p>
              AI was used in a limited and exploratory capacity during early concept stages. This included generating initial visual prompts to explore alternative logo directions before sketching, and producing illustrative profile images for target-audience personas. All final visual outcomes, designs, and visualisations presented in this report were created by me.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Scope and Limitations of AI Use</h3>
          <div class="section-brief">
            <p>
             AI was not used to generate final written content, make design decisions, or produce finished visual work. Its role was limited to language support, early idea exploration, and organisational assistance. All creative, analytical, and strategic decisions within this business plan are my own and are informed by research, reflection, and applied project work.
